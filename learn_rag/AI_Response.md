The research paper **Mem0** focuses on building AI agents with **scalable long-term memory** for production use. It introduces systems and prompts (like memory retrieval templates) to:  
1. **Store and organize** user conversation data with timestamps and relationships.  
2. **Retrieve precise information** from past interactions to generate accurate, context-aware responses.  
3. **Handle time-sensitive queries** by converting relative time references (e.g., "yesterday") to specific dates.  
4. **Evaluate response accuracy** using a "LLM-as-a-Judge" framework to ensure answers align with historical data.  

The goal is to create reliable, production-ready AI systems that retain and utilize user-specific memory effectively.
