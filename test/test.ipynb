       "[Document(metadata={'source': '5c17kgyZnWI'}, page_content=\"Hello everyone, we will continue the topic about on HANA and currently we are covering various things using Eclipse and in the last video we started with transport organizer using Eclipse. So as a part of that what are the new learnings how you can open transport organizer through eclipse you can open by this particular button or you can simply go to window in the window yes suppose if you will go to window we have a option of suppose I'll click system is slow yes I'll go to window again we'll simply Go to show view. Whenever you will go to show view you will go for other and in the other you have a appab. In the abab you have transport organizer. So this is first learning how to open transport organizer through eclipse. Then after that yes how you can release a request through transport organizer of eclipse. That is a new learning. After that yes how you can check the version how you can check this particular program is into which particular transport request. So you can simply right click whenever you will right click you will get the option of compare with you can check the revision history. So as of now yes we have only one transport request for this particular program. So these are the main points which we covered in the last video. Now into this particular video we will go for version management using Eclipse in SAP GUI. You all know how you can check the various versions of a particular object. You can simply simply go to utilities. Whenever you will go to utilities you will go for versions. You can go for version management. You can check the various version. You can compare the various version. So you can do all these things by utilities version management. But how we can go for all these things in the Eclipse. This is our learning. This will be our learning into this video. Now suppose this program we saved into one transport request. But yes, we want to move this program to the quality. It means we need to release this transport request. Suppose we released this transport request and basis person moved that request to quality. Now in the quality system testing is going on. During testing the person is saying functional person is saying in the write statement along with the result I want a additional statement suppose if I'm running this particular program I'm doing function plus f8 suppose I'm giving suppose 20 10 suppose I'm going for execute now what functional is saying I want a statement here the result is then it should print 30. So it means we need to do the additional changes but yes we need to do the additional changes in development system we cannot do in the quality system. So whenever we will do the changes in the development system it means we need to save into transport request but we cannot use the previous transport request because it is already released. Suppose now we need to create the new transport request. Now it is totally your wish you want to create the new transport request through transport organizer or you can create from here also suppose I'm writing one statement suppose I'm writing the result is the result is suppose I have done this now whenever I will activate the program. Have you seen system is prompting for new transport request? Yes, you can create a transport request from here also or you can create a transport request using transport organizer. It is totally your wish. Suppose I'm creating from here. Suppose I will give the request description. Suppose I will write suppose operation on two numbers operation on two numbers. Suppose I will give the number as two. So we can predict very easy. Now you can go for okay. Now you will say I'm not able to see the transport request number. How I can check the transport request number that currently this program is into which particular transport request. So same thing right click you can simply go to compare with now go for revision history. Whenever you will go for revision history you will be able to see two versions. Now if I will go to revision history. Now you can see this is our first request. This is our second request now 07107. Yes. So currently our program is into this transport request. Just see that description description of two numbers. You can check from this transport organizer also. Go for windows or you can simply open from here also. Suppose if I will open from here you can go to workbench. Yes. A4 Q. Yes. Currently our request is modifiable. Have you seen this is the request 907106. This our program is into this request. If I will simply doubleclick you can see operation of two numbers. Yes, this is the description which we provided. So now if I will go to this particular request now this is particular program sorry this particular program. Now these changes needs to go to the quality system. It means we need to release this particular transport request. So how how we will release this transport request? So we simply simply go to transport organizer. Yes, this request is already opened. But do not forget to release the subtask. Firstly we need to release the subtask. This is our main request. Now suppose if I will close this so many things are open. I will close the other things so I will not confuse us. We simply open two things transport organizer and our program. Okay, this is our program. Now we'll simply open the transport organizer. This is our transport organizer. Now this is our main request. I will double click. You can see firstly release the sub request. There's our sub request. Yes, you can see from here itself this is sub request. We have a release. Done. Now we will release the main request. This is our main request. Sub request is released. Now we are releasing the main request. Now release has been started. So it will release the main request also. Now the main request is released. The status is released. Now go to your program. Now this program has two versions. Two versions. How you can check? Right click compare with. You can go for revision history. You can see you are able to see this. Now the thing how I can compare these two versions. Yes. What was in the first version and what was in the second version in SAP GUI? You have a button here. You can simply select the versions. You have a option here to compare. Now here how we will do the comparison. Just select these two versions. Right click. You can see compare with each other. Now it will show you. Have you seen we have done the changes into this particular line and it is completely highlighted one. So this is our first version. This is our second version. So this is the way how you can go for version management using the Eclipse platform. So what is the summary of this particular video? In this video we covered how you can go for version management using Eclipse in SAP GUI. You all know utilities version management. So to show the demo what I did I did some additional changes in the program. I saved into new transport request. I released the transport request and I showed you. Yes, whenever you want to see the see the various version just right click onto that particular program. Whenever you will right click go for compare with you can check the revision history. If you want to compare the versions select the various version you will you have a option compare you have option compare with each other simply compare the two versions. Now in the next video we will go for various operations on the transport request using transport organizer in Eclipse because in SAP GUI you all know but our target is to become friendly with Eclipse. So that's it in this video. Thank you.\")]"
