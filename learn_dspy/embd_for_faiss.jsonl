{"doc_id": 229377, "author": "Gilles 'SO- stop being evil'", "text": "The primary command to manipulate deb packages is dpkg-deb. To unpack the package, create an empty directory and switch to it, then run dpkg-deb to extract its control information and the package files. Use dpkg-deb -b to rebuild the package. mkdir tmp dpkg-deb -R original.deb tmp # edit DEBIAN/postinst dpkg-deb -b tmp fixed.deb Beware that unless your script is running as root, the files permissions and ownership will be corrupted at the extraction stage. One way to avoid this is to run your script under fakeroot. Note that you need to run the whole sequence under fakeroot, not each dpkg-deb individually, since its the fakeroot process that keeps the memory of the permissions of the files that cant be created as they are. fakeroot sh -c  mkdir tmp dpkg-deb -R original.deb tmp # edit DEBIAN/postinst dpkg-deb -b tmp fixed.deb  Rather than mess with permissions, you can keep the data archive intact and modify only the control archive. dpkg-deb doesnt provide a way to do that. Fortunately, deb packges are in a standard format: theyre ar archives. So you can use ar to extract the control archive, modify its files, and use ar again to replace the control archive by a new version. mkdir tmp cd tmp ar p ../original.deb control.tar.gz | tar -xz # edit postinst cp ../original.deb ../fixed.deb tar czf control.tar.gz *[!z] ar r ../fixed.deb control.tar.gz You should add a changelog entry and change the version number if you modify anything in the package. The infrastructure to manipulate Debian packages assumes that if two packages have the same name and version, theyre the same package. Add a suffix to the debian_revision part at the end of the version number; for sorting reasons the suffix should start with ~, e.g. 1.2.3-4.1 becomes 1.2.3-4.1~johnjumper1. Instead of using shell tools, you can use Emacs. The dpkg-dev-el package (which is its own upstream as this is a native Debian package) contains modes to edit .deb files and to edit Debian changelogs. Emacs can be used interactively or scripted."}

{"doc_id": 557112, "author": "Randall Krieg", "text": "Heres another bit of evidence you can trust DDG if youre paranoid: they make it easy to control what information gets sent to the target host when you follow a link. Maybe you cant really know what theyre keeping in their logs, but you CAN know how they treat your interaction with the link targets, and you can control it if you like. Try this on both DuckDuckGo and Google, with Javascript enabled: 1. search for something 2. hover over one of the result links and check the address in the status bar 3. right-click one of the links, and look at the address in the status bar again On DuckDuckGo, the links are what they say they are. If you want to keep DuckDuckGo from seeing what youre clicking on, and if you want the target to be unaware that you came in via DuckDuckGo, you can do so easily: just copy the link in step 3, paste it into your address bar, and there you are -- no further interaction with DuckDuckGo and no referrer URL sent to the target site. On Google, however, note that in #2 they show you the link you expect, but in step #3 the link suddenly changes to a google.com address with a ton of gobbledeygook. This is also the address that gets used if you click the link normally. The only way to get the real target address directly is to hover over it and retype it yourself instead of clicking it. The Google client-side script is specifically designed to make sure you hit the Google tracking server before being redirected to the page you really wanted, and moreover, TO HIDE THE FACT THAT IT IS DOING SO from the vast majority of users. This is the action Google took a few years ago that finally caused me to use DDG exclusively. I understand Googles need to monetize its service, but when it purposely hides this fundamental mechanism they prove they are not trustworthy. So you can have your choice: use a site that says its not tracking you, and seems to be carrying out its promise; or use a site that tracks you every way it can, tells you its doing so, and makes it as hard as possible to evade it. The choice is obvious."}

When my computer generates a UUID, theres no practical way it can prevent your computer or any other device in the universe from generating that same UUID at some time in the future. It may not be likely that any two UUIDs will be the same, but they can be. In this case, the code assigning UUIDs to devices may check a new UUID against any existing UUIDs already assigned to devices and throw away duplicates, guaranteeing uniqueness that way. Regarding uniqueness. When a new disk is installed to a system, the usual practice is for a technician to define the partitions thereon. Labels are not unique and are not used. In the definition process, a software algorithm creates a UUID. As the system already has a list of existing mounted UUIDs, the process of defining the partition automatically creates a unique UUID value. The new UUID value filtered against the existing list of mounted UUIDs so as to avoid duplication. With partition creation,on the host system that UUID coupled with the partition number form a unique combination. Yes really. Duplication could occur if the disk is prepared on system A for use on an existing system B."}

Associate an unique Command shortcut for it, like Shift+Command+\\ or Command+F11 for example. This creates a shortcut to cause an application to enter full screen while removing the menu bar, or to exit full screen bringing the menu bar back. It provides an alternative full screen shortcut! For application-specific full screen launchers, check my other answer. Caveats There may be some disadvantages and/or misbehavior using this approach: It works by setting ApplicationType=UIElement, which causes the application icon not be added/highlighted in the Dock and make the application inaccessible via Command+Tab. The Command+Tab issue was reported in comments, I didnt notice it since I mostly use the Mission Control overview to change between full screen applications. It may not behave as expected for some specific applications, Ive noticed issues with the Activity Monitor application (which is generally not used full screen anyway) and theres a report on Chrome, which I didnt try since I use Firefox and it works great."}

{"doc_id": 426168, "author": "Max Cantor", "text": "In my experience, good programmers want to program with as few distractions as possible. Some of these are more relevant to big companies, and Im not sure where you work, but here are some examples: Casual dress code: Young programmers in particular will have a tough time avoiding resentment of a strict dress code. Im just going to sit at my desk all day--why do I need to wear slacks/polos/other uncomfortable business clothes? In my opinion, this is half rebellion and half honest productivity-seeking: It really is much easier to program in jeans and a t-shirt than slacks and a formal button-down. The question you probably need to ask yourself is if the potential productivity gain and morale boost is worth the potential loss of professional atmosphere. It all depends on your situation... there are startups and Fortune 500 companies out there which allow jeans & t-shirts. Few meetings: Almost nothing is more distracting than a constant stream of meetings. Try to avoid team-wide status meetings that could be carried out via individual e-mails or conversations. Programmers like it when their employer lets them program. Experienced coworkers: Good programmers want to improve. If any of your other employees have contributed to big open source projects, or have worked individually on some particularly successful internal projects, let your prospectives know! Private offices: This is rarely practical anywhere but venture-capitalized startups, but if you can offer candidates their own offices, theyll leave the interview with hearts in their eyes. Programming is so much easier when you arent distracted by foot traffic and people singing happy-birthday one cube over. Cool stuff: If you can afford it, subsidize games for lunch breaks and post-work hang out sessions. Best practices: This will ensnare good programmers and intimidate less experienced ones: Show that your candidates will be working with reliable, sane version control, and that there are coding standards about unit tests or inheritance or anything. Organization is important. Dont nickel-and-dime: If you can be flexible with hours, do it! No one likes having to clock out every time they go to the restroom; it feels like youre not being valued as an employee. Dual monitors: Instant win for almost any programmer whos worked with dual monitors before."}

Indeed, once their work ramps up, theyll probably realize they have little time for those perks and wonder why the company even bothers. As a junior, learning from someone who respects you, is able to teach you and is able to lead you is very enticing long-term. It may not have the interview sex appeal that the others do, but its something I think all serious developers did appreciate (or would have appreciated, if they didnt get it). Sponsor a corporate-wide subscription to Safari. Allow a junior dev to take 2 or 3 hours a day learning. Make him feel valued. Let him contribute. Which is another biggie: Make him feel like part of the team, and give him projects which not only interest him, but also challenge him. Too often, the junior dev gets the jobs like move control X to the lower right corner, or write all the property routines (or getters/setters in Java/Obj-C/et al), or add javascript validation. Give him something to do which makes him feel useful, like a real contributor. Hell appreciate that, too -- and probably become more passionate about your firm and your practices.

Rewrites are seldom the real answer. You can refactor much of the code without losing anything and without a lot of the risk.

{"doc_id": 393431, "author": "Michael Meadows", "text": "Sorry, this is going to be long, but its based on personal experience as both architect and developer on multiple rewrite projects. The following conditions should cause you to consider some sort of rewrite. Ill talk about how to decide which one to do after that. Developer ramp-up time is very high. If it takes any longer than below (by experience level) to ramp up a new developer, then the system needs to be redesigned. By ramp-up time, I mean the amount of time before the new developer is ready to do their first commit (on a small feature) Fresh out of college - 1.5 months Still green, but have worked on other projects before - 1 month Mid level - 2 weeks Experienced - 1 week Senior level - 1 day Deployment cannot be automated, because of the complexity of the existing architecture Even simple bug fixes take too long because of the complexity of existing code New features take too long, and cost too much because of the interdependence of the codebase (new features cannot be isolated, and therefore affect existing features) The formal testing cycle takes too long because of the interdependence of the existing codebase. Too many use cases are executed on too few screens. This causes training issues for the users and developers. The technology that the current system is in demands it Quality developers with experience in the technology are too hard to find It is deprecated (It cant be upgraded to support newer platforms/features) There is simply a much more expressive higher-level technology available The cost of maintaining the infrastructure of the older technology is too high These things are pretty self-evident. When to decide on a complete rewrite versus an incremental rebuild is more subjective, and therefore more politically charged. What I can say with conviction is that to categorically state that it is never a good idea is wrong. If a system can be incrementally redesigned, and you have the full support of project sponsorship for such a thing, then you should do it. Heres the problem, though. Many systems cannot be incrementally redesigned. Here are some of the reasons I have encountered that prevent this (both technical and political). Technical The coupling of components is so high that changes to a single component cannot be isolated from other components. A redesign of a single component results in a cascade of changes not only to adjacent components, but indirectly to all components. The technology stack is so complicated that future state design necessitates multiple infrastructure changes. This would be necessary in a complete rewrite as well, but if its required in an incremental redesign, then you lose that advantage. Redesigning a component results in a complete rewrite of that component anyway, because the existing design is so fubar that theres nothing worth saving. Again, you lose the advantage if this is the case. Political The sponsors cannot be made to understand that an incremental redesign requires a long-term commitment to the project. Inevitably, most organizations lose the appetite for the continuing budget drain that an incremental redesign creates. This loss of appetite is inevitable for a rewrite as well, but the sponsors will be more inclined to continue, because they dont want to be split between a partially complete new system and a partially obsolete old system. The users of the system are too attached with their current screens. If this is the case, you wont have the license to improve a vital part of the system (the front-end). A redesign lets you circumvent this problem, since theyre starting with something new. Theyll still insist on getting the same screens, but you have a little more ammunition to push back. Keep in mind that the total cost of redesiging incrementally is always higher than doing a complete rewrite, but the impact to the organization is usually smaller. In my opinion, if you can justify a rewrite, and you have superstar developers, then do it. Only do it if you can be certain that there is the political will to see it through to completion. This means both executive and end user buy-in. Without it, you will fail. Im assuming that this is why Joel says its a bad idea. Executive and end-user buy-in looks like a two-headed unicorn to many architects. You have to sell it aggressively, and campaign for its continuation continuously until its complete. Thats difficult, and youre talking about staking your reputation on something that some will not want to see succeed. Some strategies for success: If you do, however, do not try to convert existing code. Design the system from scratch. Otherwise youre wasting your time. I have never seen or heard of a conversion project that didnt end up miserably. Migrate users to the new system one team at a time. Identify the teams that have the MOST pain with the existing system, and migrate them first. Let them spread the good news by word of mouth. This way your new system will be sold from within. Design your framework as you need it. Dont start with some I-spent-6-months-building-this framework that has never seen real code. Keep your technology stack as small as possible. Dont over-design. You can add technologies as needed, but taking them out is difficult. Additionally, the more layers you have, the more work it is for developers to do things. Dont make it difficult from the get-go. Involve the users directly in the design process, but dont let them dictate how to do it. Earn their trust by showing them that you can give them what they want better if you follow good design principles."}

The support burden is high, with failures every week.

{"doc_id": 426202, "author": null, "text": "The type of people youd like to hire tends to be a first-order concern when deciding what sort of perks to offer. For the programmer whos thinking about or in the process of raising a family, paternity leave, company matching of adoption funds up to $X/year, flexible vacation and working hours, and a sense of job security may be much more attractive than a soda machine and free Segways for all. You mention that youre looking for junior or young programmers, but many young folks do still fall into this category. I sense, however, that by young, you might mean too young to be into that whole work-life balance thing. Lets call this The Google Strategy. The idea here is to make it so it just doesnt make sense to their analytical minds to ever leave work. Have on-site services like free food, drink, and laundry, provide gathering places for informal conversations. Make them feel like theyre the rock stars of the company, and theyll repay you with long hours and hard work. The good news for you is that these types of perks dont cost you much at all relative to the increased hours theyll be willing to put in. The bad news is that this model tends not to be sustainable, and this dot-com era irrational exuberance no longer satisfies your programmers when they start to want to take vacations, get married and go on a long honeymoon, have kids, and so forth. At that point, they want flexibility, more vacation time, a 401k, etc. Besides the first one, these all cost significant coin. Heres the most important point though: if youd like to hire the absolute brightest people you can find, dont try to outsmart them. Odds are, the really sharp ones will be a little less interested in the size of the Free Red Bull Fridge and the number of air hockey tables at their disposal, than whether youll value them as an asset to the company and as an individual (both in terms of compensation and employer/employee relations in general), whether you have a sustainable business model/plan, whether your work really excites them, and whether your work really excites you. Id suggest reading a couple essays on Joel On Software, he treats the subject of hiring good programmers in a fair amount of detail (Smart, and Gets Things Done, I think, is the name of one of the essays). While your question certainly isnt without merit, and providing a work environment with some of the same perks as your competitors will make your sales pitch somewhat easier, the only people that will be truly swayed by these kinds of things are not the people you want the success of your small company to depend on. Good developers want to feel like theyre making a contribution to something that matters, like their skills are valued and put to good use, like they are responsible to their peers and to themselves. Focus on having a truly great, dynamic company that does great work, and that treats its technical people with respect (things like private offices help here, too), and youll really attract the type of people youre looking for.

{"doc_id": 65773, "author": "bodangly", "text": "Just a few examples why its not ok to always run as root: Root user can easily place files in locations that are far more difficult to track down. Root user has raw access to interfaces and so can put an interface into promiscuous or monitor mode and log ALL network traffic. Root user has raw access to device nodes and can thrash a disk making it far harder to recover files than a simple rm at user level. Root user can also potentially modify boot sectors of a drive, making malware persistent even after a reinstall of the operating system. I could go on. The point is that there ARE good reasons not to run as root. I dont disagree that to most people their most personal data is in their home directory anyhow, but running as root still does put that data, and the entire system, at a greater risk. The advice to not run as root is not misplaced. If a person does not understand the implications of running as root, they definitely should not be doing so.

Dual monitors, or one large(30+) high resolution widescreen format LCD. The productivity gain from having multiple monitors is amazing. Imagine a secretary having to work in an office with only a single file cabinet with just one drawer. Thats what development on a single 17 4:3 aspect ratio monitor is like. Quiet. Even if you cant afford private offices for the developers, providing the developers with a space separate from marketing and people whose jobs are to talk to your customer base, or the sales team is very important to a developer. A developer has chosen to work with computers, and not people, because they are likely not an extrovert. Therefore, keeping them sheltered from the sales teams pep-talks and team building exercises will be very valuable. If you have to have a giant open floor plan for the entire business, look at getting some banners or sound dampening to hang from the ceiling. Respect. Your developers are building the tools that your company uses to be more profitable. They may be making the software you sell, or the software that gives your company the advantage you need to be competitive, treat them with respect. Books. Developers need knowledge like plants need water. If a developer isnt given an outlet to learn new techniques and practices, they will search for it themselves. Give your developers a quarterly library fund, or have a company library they can get books from, and request new books be added to. You can create an internal website which the developers can vote for new additions to the library with, and buy them once a quarter. A subscription to an online library resource like Safaribooks.com A sense of being appreciated. You chose to hire these particular developers for a reason. Make them feel like they are special in some way. Have a quarterly/ monthly guest speaker, as you can afford it. If you cant afford a guest speaker, send some of them to conferences and workshops. Rotate your developers through conferences, so that everyone has the opportunity to go. Managers who understand what is involved in developing software. Developing software is not the same thing as digging a ditch or laying bricks. A developer will not spend 8/8 hours writing code. Plenty of time will be spent on research, whether requirements gathering/ clarification, or on the right approach to solve a particular problem. In physical engineering, prototypes and stepwise refinement are part of the iterative development of a product. The same is true in software. Just because the final check-in for a task is only a few text files, doesnt mean that the developer didnt spend a lot of effort refining that feature or bug fix. Guidance. As a recent college grad, your new developers are going to need someone whos been around to guide them to the correct technologies and practices to use to increase their value, both for the company and for themselves."}

{"doc_id": 65916, "author": "Mike Ciaraldi", "text": "Back around 1990 I was working on a project with a guy named Tom. We were using a SUN server running SunOS (a Unix derivative, predecessor to Solaris). This was back in the days before CD drives and flash drives, so if you messed up the OS on your hard drive there was no way to recover. Tom used to routinely log in as root. I told him that was a bad idea, but he did not listen. One day I heard him say Uh-oh. He had meant to type comething like this: mv something* . Unfortunately he left off the final dot, so the shell expanded all the file and directory names which matched this pattern. Then the mv command used whatever ended up as the final name in the list as the destination directory, and moved everything else into it. Also unfortunately, he was currently at the root directory, so basically the entire file system got moved into one of its subdirectories. I used up-arrow to bring back the previous command and saw what had happened. The first thing I then said was, Dont log off! Or you will never be able to log in again. No problem, right? We could just move everything back. We could, except that the mv command was not one of the built-in commands of the shell. Instead, it was an executable program, stored in one of the files which had been moved. Luckily, ls was a built-in command, so after using ls to confirm where the commands had moved to, I was able to find the mv command, invoke it with its full path name, and put things back where they were supposed to be. And then I told him, Tom, this is why it is a bad idea to routinely log in as root."}

{"doc_id": 65966, "author": "Gordon Davisson", "text": "First: the name rootless is misleading, since theres still a root account, and you can still access it (the official name, System Integrity Protection, is more accurate). What it really does is limit the power of the root account, so that even if you become root, you dont have full control over the system. Essentially, the idea is that its too easy for malware to get root access (e.g. by presenting an auth dialog to the user, which will cause the user to reflexively enter the admin password). SIP adds another layer of protection, which malware cant penetrate even if it gets root. The bad part of this, of course, it that it must also apply to things youre doing intentionally. But the restrictions it places on root arent that bad; they dont prevent most normal system customization. Heres what it restricts, even from root: You cant modify anything in /System, /bin, /sbin, or /usr (except /usr/local); or any of the built-in apps and utilities. Only Installer and software update can modify these areas, and even they only do it when installing Apple-signed packages. But since normal OS X-style customizations go in /Library (or ~/Library, or /Applications), and unix-style customizations (e.g. Homebrew) go in /usr/local (or sometimes /etc or /opt), this shouldnt be a big deal. It also prevents block-level writes to the startup disk, so you cant bypass it that way. The full list of restricted directories (and exceptions like /usr/local and a few others) is in /System/Library/Sandbox/rootless.conf. Of course, this file is itself in a restricted area. When you upgrade to El Capitan, it moves any unauthorized files from restricted areas to /Library/SystemMigration/History/Migration-(some UUID)/QuarantineRoot/. You cant attach to system processes (e.g. those running from those system locations) for things like debugging (or changing what dynamic libraries they load, or some other things). Again, not too much of a big deal; developers can still debug their own programs. This does block some significant things like injecting code into the built-in Apple apps (notably the Finder). It also means that dtrace-based tools for system monitoring (e.g. opensnoop) will not be able to monitor & report on many system processes. You cant load kernel extensions (kexts) unless theyre properly signed (i.e. by Apple or an Apple-approved developer). Note that this replaces the old system for enforcing kext signing (and the old ways of bypassing it). But since v10.10.4 Apple has had a way to enable trim support for third-party SSDs, the #1 reason to use unsigned kexts has gone away. Starting in Sierra (10.12), some launchd configuration settings cannot be changed (for example, some launch daemons cannot be unloaded). Starting in Mojave (10.14), access to users personal information (email, contacts, etc) is restricted to apps that the user has approved to access that info. This is generally considered a separate feature (called Personal Information Protection, or TCC), but its based on SIP and disabling SIP disables it as well. See: What and how does macOS Mojave implement to restrict applications access to personal data? Starting in Catalina (10.15), protection of most system files is strengthened by storing them on a separate read-only volume. This is not strictly part of SIP, and is not disabled by disabling SIP. See: WWDC presentation on Whats New in Apple [Catalina] File Systems and Whats /System/Volumes/Data?. Starting in Big Sur (11.x), the read-only system volume is now a Sealed System Volume (a mounted snapshot rather than a regular volume), so making changes to it is even more complicated. See: the Eclectic Light Company article Big Sur boot volume layout. If you dont want these restrictions -- either because you want to modify your system beyond what this allows, or because youre developing & debugging something like kexts that arent practical under these restrictions, you can turn SIP off. Currently this requires rebooting into recovery mode and running the command csrutil disable (and you can similarly re-enable it with csrutil enable). Modifying the system volume in Catalina requires disabling SIP, then mounting the volume with write access (and then rebooting and turning SIP back on is recommended). In Big Sur, additional steps are required to disable authentication of the system volume before changes, and afterward create a new snapshot. You can also selectively disable parts of SIP. For example, csrutil enable --without kext will disable SIPs kernel extension restriction, but leave its other protections in place. But please stop and think before disabling SIP, even temporarily or partially: do you really need to disable it, or is there a better (SIP-compliant) way to do what you want? Do you really need to modify something in /System/Library or /bin or whatever, or could it go in a better place like /Library or /usr/local/bin etc? SIP may feel constraining if you arent used to it, and there are some legitimate reasons to disable it, but a lot of what it enforces it really just best practice anyway. To underscore the importance of leaving as much of SIP enabled as much of the time as possible, consider the events of September 23, 2019. Google released an update to Chrome that tried to replace the symbolic link from /var to /private/var. On most systems, SIP blocked this and there were no bad effects. On systems with SIP disabled, it rendered macOS broken and unbootable. The most common reason for disabling SIP was to load unapproved (/improperly signed) kernel extensions (specifically video drivers); if theyd only disabled the kext restriction, they would not have been affected. See the official Google support thread, a superuser Q&A on it, and an Ars Technica article. References and further info: WWDC presentation on Security and Your Apps, a good explanation by Eldad Eilam on quora.com, the Ars Technica review of El Capitan, and an Apple support article on SIP, and a deep dive by Rich Trouton (who also posted an answer to this question)."}

In other words, to be successful, a DOS needs an action to require very few resources client-side (so the each clients can send a lot of requests) while involving larger resources server-side (so the server(s) will be unable to handle the load). Due to this, DDOS attacks (the Distributed version of DOS attacks) are obviously not engaged by real humans clicking on links in a browser tab, but by bots sending massive amount of parallel requests to the target. The consequence of this is that the DDOS client is not a real browser, but a tool which may more-or-less simulate one. Cloudflare DDOS protection system is quickly described on their website as follow: an interstitial page is presented to your site\u2019s visitors for 5 seconds while the checks are completed. Two things trigger my attention here: The checks: the most obvious way to sort real website users from automatic DDOS bots is to check whether the HTTP client is a real browser or not. This can go through testing the clients behavior against a panel of tests (see the post bot detection via browser fingerprinting for instance) and compare the result with the one expected from a genuine instance of the browser the client claims to be (for instance if the client claims to be a Firefox version 52 running on a Windows 10 machine, does it present the same characteristics?). 5 seconds: Executing JavaScript tests and redirecting the visitor could be a very fast and almost transparent operation, so I believe that this 5 seconds timeout is not there by accident but is meant to revert the computational asymmetry back in favor of the server. The most light version of such principle would simply be to ask the client to wait (sleep) 5 seconds before resubmitting the same request (with a unique identifier stored in a cookie, as described on Cloudflare page). This would force the DDOS client to somehow handle a queue of pending redirections, and would finally make the overall DDOS process less effective. A more brutal alternative would be to request the browser to solve some mathematical challenge which would require a few seconds to be solved on an average home system. In such a case, attackers would have no other choice than spend computational power to solve these challenges if they would like to proceed, but doing so will completely void the asymmetry since all the attackers resource will be busy in solving challenges instead of sending requests, finally DOSing the attackers system instead of the targets one."}

Then, the USB port would have 300 mA left to charge the battery while the wall USB charger would have 800 mA left. A typical smart phone battery has a capacity of about 1500 mAh (milliamperes-hour) nowadays. This means that in a perfectly efficient world, a current of 1500 mA would charge the battery in 1 hour. So the same battery would then charge in 5 hours over the USB 2.0 port and in about 1h50 with the wall charger.

{"doc_id": 590374, "author": "Trey Blalock", "text": "Deep Packet Inspection, also known as complete packet inspection, simply means they are analyzing all of your traffic as opposed to just grabbing connection information such as what IPs you are connecting to, what port number, what protocol and possibly a few other details about the network connection. This is normally discussed in contrast to the gathering of NetFlow information which mainly collects the information listed above. Deep packet inspection gives your provider a lot of information about your connections and habits of Internet usage. In some cases, the full content of things like SMTP e-mails will be captured. HTTPS does encrypt the connections but your browser has to make DNS requests which are sent primarily via UDP so that data will be collected as will any unencrypted links or unencrypted cookies sent incorrectly without https. These additional bits which will be collected may be very telling about what type of content you are looking at. The larger concern for most people is about data aggregation, by collecting this information a data scientist could create a fingerprint for your Internet usage and later associate with past activities or activities from other locations (when you are at work or are on vacation). Likewise, your service provider may choose to sell this to any number of organizations (possibly including criminal organizations) where it could then be used against you in ways. In many countries, people have an expectation that their communications are considered to be private and collecting this data very much goes against that privacy expectation. Another interesting aspect of this is in the cases like the US where this data may soon be sold it allows International communications sent to people, or servers, in the US be sold as well. Likewise, this could potentially allow every agency from local law-enforcement, military, tax authorities, immigration authorities, politicians, etc. a way to bypass long-standing laws which have prevented them from accessing this type of information, or important informational subsets within this data otherwise. A slightly different concern when this data can be sold is competitive intelligence / corporate espionage. In the scenario where a company does a lot of research-intensive work at their headquarters located in some small geographical location (think of pharmaceuticals or a defense contractor) selling that data makes it possible for anyone to buy all of the traffic from the local ISP where most of those researchers live and analyze what they are looking for when at home, possibly even directly from the ISP hosting the traffic for their corporate headquarters. If other countries arent selling similar data it gives foreign companies and companies wise enough to try and buy this data a huge technical advantage. Likewise, it would also allow foreign governments to buy ISP traffic which includes the data from US (or other government) Officials homes. Imagine companies monitoring their employees behavior at home or on their mobile devices. This will likely have a chilling effect on activists and whistle-blowers as well. Likewise, if credit cards or PII are sent in the clear to a poorly secured remote site your ISPs data set now has a potential PCI or PII regulatory issue on their hands. So this amplifies data-leakage problems of all types by making additional copies of the data leaked. With the examples Ive just mentioned above, and there are hundreds of others, it should be easy to see why this type of data collection has a different level of importance to it than just metadata or basic connection information. Even if your ISP never sells this data they are collecting quite an interesting dataset. Its a security issue that definitely has a lot of potential long-term security implications."}
{"doc_id": 590375, "author": "MiaoHatola", "text": "Trey Blalocks answer describes percisely what deep packet inspection (DPI) is. But Id like to add three things to hopefully answer your specific questions: There is a technique of DPI that does decrypt your data, called SSL interception, although it is more common in enterprise situations and only possible if the ISP (or any other interceptor) has the ability to install a certificate on your machine. So unless the ISP had some way of doing that (technician etc.) this is probably off the table. HTTPS would prevent the ISP from being able to read data. Of course, This is only true for services that use HTTPS (which unfortunately is not all of them). Also you need to consider that the ISP can read metadata whether the connection is encrypted or not. A VPN would protect you against DPI performed by the ISP (not by the VPN provider). This is thanks to the fact that VPNs use an encrypted tunnel to connect you to the exit node. This encrypts all of your traffic, and all of the metadata will show packets leaving your computer and going to the VPN server (thus not disclosing the actual server you are accessing)."}

To add on to Miaos answer: Things DPI can see, even when you use HTTPS: DNS information, e.g. https://catvideos.com/tigers - they will see https://catvideos.com IP address connectivity. So, even you you HTTPS to that site with cat videos, they can see that you connected to that cat video site and downloaded 500 GB of data. They dont know what data, but they know the DNS name, and the IP address, and amount of data to that site, and to every site. Ads. Many/most Ad networks do not use HTTPS, so that data is not always encrypted. This can result in a mixed encryption or similar warning from a browser. other data: Many sites using HTTPS for login will then drop the encryption for everything else. graphics: many sites wont encrypt things like their logo or various graphic or video files. They may encrypt your login and search, but not results. other non-HTTPS traffic like UDP, mail, SNMP, ftp, telnet, updates to some software might not use HTTPS, etc. With a VPN, they will still see 100% of the data. However, other than the connection to the VPN provider, theyll only see encrypted data. They will know that you downloaded 800GB from VPNco.com, but will know nothing of the data inside. Even things that are not encrypted via protocol will get encrypted since a lower level is encrypting. Now, the VPNco.com will then see your data. With the (potential) change in US law about ISP and data privacy, combined with the (potential) loss of net neutrality, ISPs might be able to not only see 100% of your data, they could modify that data, slow or block sites they want, and might be able to sell any/all of your data to a 3rd party (as Trey states).

Did the bits get clogged? Of course not. Youre just running more invisible background services. First, disable auto updates in Samsung galaxy store (if applicable), in settings > software updates, In secret developer options menu (look it up) and Google play store This is important because otherwise they just reinstall / update themselves. Then look for apps that open automatically after removing them from via device maintenance > clear memory & developer options > running services and uninstall or reset them to factory default to as many as you can (I also remove permissions from them so they cant read from storage secretly in the background etc.). Some system apps you may want to keep, such as Google play services etc. Just uninstall the ones you are confident you understand are not needed Remember, clearing the memory does NOT speed up the device, it only shows you what apps autoload background processes so you can uninstall them. A good example of this is Instagram, if you notice it keeps running while its closed, because it will preload dozens of Instagram videos in your feed before you even open the app. While preloading is generally seen as an optimization, if you have enough apps aggressively preloading at the same time, and security apps monitoring those apps, and RAM filling up which then kicks off garbage collection on the Java runtime, and possibly even memory paging, plus any activity you actually request, plus reporting your location to Google, plus reporting your location to find your phone programs, plus checking traffic on your future commute, plus parsing your calendar for AI usage with Google Home, plus updates checking, plus notification querying, etc etc, then you may find that your device is doing far more activity than it can handle. Simple way to test this is to turn on Max Battery Saving option and see if the battery and responsiveness improves. If so, its in large part because all the extensive background processing is disallowed. Also remember that disabling auto updates does not speed up the phone per se, it just allows you prevent future updates from causing unexpected performance degradation. It makes you the gatekeeper so your phone cannot magically slow down overtime, but rather lets you pick and choose what apps you trust to update (and of course, update the apps you love.) Its like Kon Mari method for your phone. Remember, phones dont get slow over time. Bad programming in Updates cause phones to get slow. And this will get you back to a smooth android like the day you bought it (also good for battery) Ive had outstanding success with this. And my frame rate is 2x better as well as app open speed.

POSIX does not specify /var/tmp. The FHS does though: The /var/tmp directory is made available for programs that require temporary files or directories that are preserved between system reboots. Therefore, data stored in /var/tmp is more persistent than data in /tmp. Files and directories located in /var/tmp must not be deleted when the system is booted. Although data stored in /var/tmp is typically deleted in a site-specific manner, it is recommended that deletions occur at a less frequent interval than /tmp."}

{"doc_id": 262842, "author": "JdeBP", "text": "chaos answer is what some documentation says. But its not what systemd actually does. (Its not what van Smoorenburg rc did, either. The van Smoorenburg rc most definitely did not ignore LSB headers, which insserv used to calculate static orderings, for starters.) The Freedesktop documentation, such as that Incompatibilities page, is in fact wrong, on these and other points. (The HOME environment variable in fact is often set, for example. This went wholly undocumented anywhere for a long time. Its now documented in the manual, at least, but that Freedesktop WWW page still hasnt been corrected.) The native service format for systemd is the service unit. systemds service management proper operates solely in terms of those, which it reads from one of nine directories where (system-wide) .service files can live. /etc/systemd/system, /run/systemd/system, /usr/local/lib/systemd/system, and /usr/lib/systemd/system are four of those directories. The compatibility with van Smoorenburg rc scripts is achieved with a conversion program, named systemd-sysv-generator. This program is listed in the /usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/ directory and is thus run automatically by systemd early in the bootstrap process at every boot, and again every time that systemd is instructed to re-load its configuration later on. This program is a generator, a type of ancillary utility whose job is to create service unit files on the fly, in a tmpfs where three more of those nine directories (which are intended to be used only by generators) are located. systemd-sysv-generator generates the service units that run the van Smoorenburg rc scripts from /etc/init.d, if it doesnt find a native systemd service unit by that name already existing in the other six locations. systemd service management only knows about service units. These automatically (re-)generated service units are written to invoke the van Smoorenburg rc scripts. They have, amongst other things: [Unit] SourcePath=/etc/init.d/wibble [Service] ExecStart=/etc/init.d/wibble start ExecStop=/etc/init.d/wibble stop Received wisdom is that the van Smoorenburg rc scripts must have an LSB header, and are run in parallel without honouring the priorities imposed by the /etc/rc?.d/ system. This is incorrect on all points. In fact, they dont need to have an LSB header, and if they do not systemd-sysv-generator can recognize the more limited old RedHat comment headers (description:, pidfile:, and so forth). Moreover, in the absence of an LSB header it will fall back to the contents of the /etc/rc?.d symbolic link farms, reading the priorities encoded into the link names and constructing a before/after ordering from them, serializing the services. Not only are LSB headers not a requirement, and not only do they themselves encode before/after orderings that serialize things to an extent, the fallback behaviour in their complete absence is actually significantly non-parallelized operation. The reason that /etc/rc3.d didnt appear to matter is that you probably had that script enabled via another /etc/rc?.d/ directory. systemd-sysv-generator translates being listed in any of /etc/rc2.d/, /etc/rc3.d/, and /etc/rc4.d/ into a native Wanted-By relationship to systemds multi-user.target. Run levels are obsolete in the systemd world, and you can forget about them. Further reading systemd-sysv-generator. systemd manual pages. Freedesktop.org.

Also, their usage is limited to the interactive sessions. Finally, note that you can have arbitrary computation in an alias by declaring a function a immediately calling it, like so: alias a_complex_thing=f() { do_stuff_in_function; } f which is already in widespread use in case of Git aliases.

That will maximize the entropy. If the PIN is chosen by a human operator, it makes perfect sense to exclude some combinations. I wouldnt go as far as rejecting half of the combinations, but if you do, you should also consider reject PINs starting with 0 1 and 2 (think birth years and dates) then PINs corresponding to physical key layouts like 2580 and 1379 and so on and so forth. Just make sure you stop before you end up allowing a single 8068 PIN which this study has found to be the least probable. What you should do for human-chosen PINs is excluding the most common combinations: 1234 and 1111 alone account for almost 17% of all PINs in use, and 20 most popular PINs account for almost 27%. Those include each digit repeated 4 times and popular combinations like 1212 and 4321. Edit: on a second thought, I think you should exclude most common combinations in any case. Even if your PIN is randomly generated, the attacker may not know that, in which case they will most probably try those combinations first."}

The top answers however fail to touch on the physical aspect of entering a pin. Visual and thermovisual extraction are a real danger these days. In other words, bad guys shoulder-surfing your pincode either with their eyes, a telescope, a skimming camera on the ATM or even thermal imaging cameras. That last one is more recent, and especially nasty as a skimmer can walk up to a pin pad and look at the heat signature, even if you covered the pad well. Having a consecutive pin will hurt security in this area; it reduces the complexity of the physical location of the numbers by a horrible amount.

Because Google is a huge network, it needs some time that old passwords are disabled for POP3 access. This gives the attacker the possibility to reset your password again and again. Even if you regain access with the reset function and validate yourself with your mailbox access on your smartphone or an reset strategy via SMS to your smartphone, the attacker (who still has access to your mailbox via POP3 with the old or his own passwords) can reset your password. With such an attack the victim cant be lock you out forever, because the attacker cant remove a reset strategy like a SMS number - but it surly states a very high risk.

You issue a SYN, if the server does not reply, or replies with ICMP error : it means that the port is filtered. Likely an IDS / statefull firewall block your request) To figure what is the real status of the port, you can : use the -sV, or -A option (version detection, it will help you to determine what is the status of this port. use --tcp-flags SYN,FIN to try bypassing the fw. use other scan types (http://nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) The excellent Nmap Network Discovery book, written by its creator Fyodor explains this very well. I quote filtered : Nmap cannot determine whether the port is open because packet filtering prevents its probes from reaching the port. The filtering could be from a dedicated firewall device, router rules, or host-based firewall software. These ports frustrate attackers because they provide so little information. Sometimes they respond with ICMP error messages such as type 3 code 13 (destination unreachable: communication administratively prohibited), but filters that simply drop probes without responding are far more common. This forces Nmap to retry several times just in case the probe was dropped due to network congestion rather than filtering. This sort of filtering slows scans down dramatically. open|filtered : Nmap places ports in this state when it is unable to determine whether a port is open or filtered. This occurs for scan types in which open ports give no response. The lack of response could also mean that a packet filter dropped the probe or any response it elicited. So Nmap does not know for sure whether the port is open or being filtered. The UDP, IP protocol, FIN, NULL, and Xmas scans classify ports this way. closed|filtered : This state is used when Nmap is unable to determine whether a port is closed or filtered.

Fragmented traffic increases the CPU burden of a device and decreases performance because of the need for the fragmentation needed extra traffic. Considering the goal of a dynamic routing protocol is it be a stable and fast converging protocol, anything contrary to those goals should be eliminated. Setting the requirement for the MTUs to match helps enforce this performance requirement. More from the OSPF RFC: 4.3. Routing protocol packets The OSPF protocol runs directly over IP, using IP protocol 89. OSPF does not provide any explicit fragmentation/reassembly support.

Without a salt, the hash can be attacked with a rainbow table: a pre-computed dictionary which associates passwords with hashes. An N-bit salt increases the storage requirement for a rainbow table, and the time to compute that table, by a factor of 2**N. So for instance, with a 32 bit salt, just a single rainbow table dictionary entry, say for the password passw0rd, requires many gigabytes of storage, making such a rainbow table very expensive using current storage hardware. So when a salt is present, the attacker is reduced to a brute force attack on the specific set of password hashes that have been obtained. However: for weak passwords, a brute force attack will succeed in relatively little time. sufficiently strong passwords will not be found in a rainbow table. if the attacker has access to the hashes, system security has been compromised already: modern systems and protocols do not reveal their password hashes. If the attacker is not able to gain access to the password database, the passwords may as well be stored in plaintext. if an attacker must compromise the system to get to the hashes in order to reverse passwords from them, then the only passwords which have value to the attacker are those which are re-used for other security domains to which the attacker has no access yet. Passwords which are not reused have no value (and certainly less value than other sensitive information associated with the accounts). Say user joewestlake uses the password god1234. The attacker reverses this instantly using a rainbow table. (Or within mere minutes of cracking using a brute-force attack, if the hash is salted, since the password is so bad.) Now the problem is that joewestlake also used god1234 for his Gmail account, and for online banking, oops! Now the attacker reads Joes e-mails, and learns enough about Joe so that he can easily answer the question what was the name of your first pet when logging in to Joes online banking. So, the rationale for salts is that they somewhat protect users by making medium-security passwords harder to reverse: passwords which, without a salt, could reasonably be expected to be found in a rainbow table, but which are strong enough that individually brute-forcing them takes a very long time. But salts provide this benefit only in the event that the hashes are compromised, which is already a serious security breach, and the benefit is only for those users who re-use their medium-security passwords in other systems. Say Joe instead used a password made of 10 random alphanumeric characters and symbols. This could still be in a rainbow table, but takes a lot of work crack. So even if Joe used the same password for Gmail and online banking, he is safe, thanks to the salt. The cracker runs his brute-force crack for perhaps several hours, maybe days. The crack yields numerous weak passwords from others users of the same system who have weak passwords. The attacker is satisfied with that yield and stops cracking; Joes password is never reversed. Furthermore, if the breach is detected and users (including Joe) are advised to change their passwords, then Joe has a chance to outrun the attackers cracking attempts, even if the attacker persists in attacking the entire medium-security password space that includes Joes password. Joe knows that, the password he used on the compromised system is exactly the same as his Gmail and banking password, so he scrambles to change those other two. The salt helps here because it buys time for password-reusing users to change their password. The salt wont help those with very weak passwords which are cracked in minutes, but users of passwords which take hours or days to crack have a fighting chance."}

It doesnt genuinely protect anything inside the class. Why do we care about genuinely protecting the stuff inside the class? Because otherwise it would be impossible to change implementation details without breaking client code. Put another way, people who write subclasses are also the outer world for the person who wrote the original base class. In practice, protected members are essentially a class public API for subclasses and need to remain stable and backwards compatible just as much as public members do. If we did not have the ability to create true private members, then nothing in an implementation would ever be safe to change, because you wouldnt be able to rule out the possibility that (non-malicious) client code has somehow managed to depend on it. Incidentally, while In OOP, sooner or later, you are going to make a subclass of a class is technically true, your argument seems to be making the much stronger assumption that sooner or later, you are going to make a subclass of every class which is almost certainly not the case."}
{"doc_id": 492371, "author": "Sebastian Redl", "text": "In OOP, sooner or later, you are going to make a subclass of a class This is wrong. Not every class is meant to be subclassed and some statically typed OOP languages even have features to prevent it, e.g., final (Java and C++) or sealed (C#). it is good to understand and being able to modify the implementation completely. No, its not. Its good for a class to be able to clearly define its public interface and preserve its invariants even if it is inherited from. In general, access control is about compartmentalization. You want an individual part of the code to be understood without having to understand in detail how it interacts with the rest of the code. Private access allows that. If everything is at least protected, you have to understand what every subclass does in order to understand how the base class works. Or to put it in the terms of Scott Meyers: private parts of a class are affected by a finite amount of code: the code of the class itself. Public parts are potentially affected by every bit of code in existence, and every bit of code yet to be written, which is an infinite amount of code. Protected parts are potentially affected by every existing subclass, and every subclass yet to be written, which is also an infinite amount of code. The conclusion is that protected gives you very little more than public, whereas private gives you a real improvement. It is the existence of the protected access specifier that is questionable, not private."}

Just this week I needed to write a custom dictionary implementation where I controlled what was put into the dictionary. If the dictionary field were to be made protected or public, then the controls Id so carefully written could have been easily circumvented. Private fields are typically about providing safeguards that the data is as the original coder expected. Make everything protected/public and you ride a coach and horses through those procedures and validation."}

Via Bash through the terminal find ~ -type f -name *pdf or find ~ -iname *pdf (or, if you want to ignore error messages, find ~ -type f -name *pdf 2>/dev/null) or you can use this to search for a string in a file: find ~ -iname *txt | xargs grep string you want This may not return anything on a pdf, but it will work on most other file types (text, php, py, html, etc)."}
{"doc_id": 492374, "author": "Ben Cottrell", "text": "private variables in a class are better than protected for the same reason that a break statement inside a switch block is better than a goto label statement; which is that human programmers are error-prone. protected variables lend themselves to un-intentional abuse (programmer mistakes), just as the goto statement lends itself to the creation of spaghetti code. Is it possible to write working bug-free code using protected class variables? Yes of course! Just as its possible to write working bug-free code using goto; but as the cliche goes Just because you can, doesnt mean you should! Classes, and indeed the OO paradigm, exist to guard against hapless error-prone human programmers making mistakes. The defense against human mistakes is only as good as the defensive measures built into the class. Making the implementation of your class protected is the equivalent of blowing an enormous hole in the walls of a fortress. Base classes have absolutely no knowledge of derived classes. As far as a base class is concerned, protected does not actually give you any more protection than public, because theres nothing stopping a derived class from creating a public getter/setter which behaves like a backdoor. If a base class permits un-hindered access to its internal implementation details, then it becomes impossible for the class itself to defend against mistakes. Base classes have absolutely no knowledge of their derived classes, and therefore have no way of guarding against mistakes made in those derived classes. The best thing a base class can do is hide as much of its implementation as possible as private and put enough restrictions in place to guard against breaking changes from derived classes or anything else outside of the class. Ultimately, high-level languages exist to minimise human errors. Good programming practises (such as SOLID principles) also exist to minimise human errors. Software developers who ignore good programming practices have a much higher chance of failure, and are more likely to produce broken unmaintainable solutions. Those who follow good practices have a much lower chance of failure, and are more likely to produce working maintainable solutions."}
{"doc_id": 197469, "author": "gertvdijk", "text": "Good answer is already posted by @StevenD, yet I think this might clarify it a bit more. The reason that the process is killed on termination of the terminal is that the process you start is a child process of the terminal. Once you close the terminal, this will kill these child processes as well. You can see the process tree with pstree, for example when running kate & in Konsole: init-+ \u251c\u2500konsole\u2500\u252c\u2500bash\u2500\u252c\u2500kate\u2500\u2500\u25002*[{kate}] \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500pstree \u2502 \u2514\u25002*[{konsole}] To make the kate process detached from konsole when you terminate konsole, use nohup with the command, like this: nohup kate & After closing konsole, pstree will look like this: init-+ |-kate---2*[{kate}] and kate will survive. :) An alternative is using screen/tmux/byobu, which will keep the shell running, independent of the terminal."}
