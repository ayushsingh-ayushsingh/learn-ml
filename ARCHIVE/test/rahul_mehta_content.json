            "page_content": "Hello everyone, we will continue the topic about on HANA and currently we are becoming familiar with Eclipse. So as a part of that in the last videos we started with transport organizer in Eclipse. We all know yes in SAP GUI SE09 or SC10 are the transaction codes for transport organizer and we are very much familiar with that but now we need to become familiar with Eclipse transport organizer in Eclipse and into this particular video we will go for various operations on the transport request using the transport organizer. But now the platform is Eclipse. If you all know yes when we covered the transport organizer playlist at that time we covered so many operations on the transport request but at the time we used SC09 or SC10 transaction code but now we need to use Eclipse platform. If you remember at that time we did so many things. How to change the description of ATR. How to change how to add users to a transport request. How to delete object. How to add object? How to delete ATR. Now we will go for same to same operations that is using transport organizer only. But now the platform will be Eclipse. So firstly we start with creation of transport request. Yes in the last to last video we already covered yes how to create a transport request but I will create a transport request so that these all operations we can covered onto that. So what I will do firstly I will go to transport organizer. You all know how you can go to transport organizer in Eclipse platform window show view. You need to go to other whenever you will go to other. Yes, in aab you have a option of this transport organizer. You can search also. I will go to transport organizer and you can see transport organizer opened. Yes. After that you can simply navigate from here also. It's totally your wish. Now I will simply expand. Now we will create a workbench request. Now you all know how to create a workbench request. You can simply simply right click on to workbench request. New transport request. Suppose I will give some description to the transport request. Suppose I will write operation on two numbers. System is slow. I just wait operation on two numbers. Suppose I will pass the target system. I'll simply browse A4Q quality system. I will go for finish. Now you can see transport request generated 907139 and this is the subtask 90714. Now what I will do? I will save some I will save one program into this particular transport request. Suppose I will go for same to same program which I created previously. Yes, at that time yes we released both the transport request. Now I will save into this particular TR. So I'll go to my package. Yes. Now I will go to my programs. You all know this is the program which we created but we released both the TR. Yes. So whenever I will just go for some changes suppose whenever I will go for activate or you can go for save you can see system prompted for the transport request because previously the both the request are released. So if we are going for further changes yes it means we need to save into transport request. This is the transport request which we check which we created just now. I'll go for okay. Now if I will show you transport organizer you can see in the transport organizer if I will go to our workbench request 907139 you will be able to see the object. You can see our program is the part of sub request. No. Now suppose now customer is saying suppose you want to release this particular transport request. But yes in the projects description play a vital role for the transport request. We always give a very powerful description. I'll say very precise description. The best word is so that by the description itself we can predict what is the purpose of this transport request. Suppose we gave the description operation on two numbers and your supervisor is saying yes okay I want the description I want a precise description of this particular transport request. Suppose they are saying you need to put a serial number at the starting of the transport request. Suppose we'll go for serial number serial number. Now, now you want to change the description. That is our first operation on that transport request. This is done. Yes. Now, what is our second operation? We want to change the description of that transport request. You all know how you can change through SC09 transaction code. But how you can change through Eclipse platform. So, how you can change? Suppose simply go to transport organizer from here or you can simply go from window show view you can go to others you can go to transport organizer suppose go for your transport request once you doubleclick yes you will be able to see this now you can change the short description from here itself suppose we want to give the serial number serial number suppose we will go for one next time serial number two serial number three because your supervisor is saying okay I want a serial number at the start of the transport request so now you did you change the description but you want to save that description so we have a save button you can simply go for save so this description is saved now I'll show you yes suppose if I I will show you in SAP GUI. You will be able to see the description has changed 907139. Now you can see 90713. Now you can see the description. This was the description. Now this is the description. Now we will move further. So these two operations covered. This one was covered previously also. Now we covered again because we need to go for further more operation. Now I'm coming on to next operation. Next is changing the owner of a transport request. Now we are now the suppose you create one transport request. Okay. Now your supervisor is saying make the owner of this request as another person or another user. So how you can change the owner of a transport request? So if I will go to the transport request. See as of now I am the owner of this transport request. You can see I am the owner of this transport request. Suppose if I want to make someone else as a owner of this transport request. So I'll simply go to browse. This is transport organizer only. Now you can simply go to browse. you will be able to see the users whatever the users are there in the system. So you can simply simply pass that user and you can change the owner. Suppose I'm taking some another owner. Suppose I'm taking this user as the owner. I'll change also. I'll keep it mine again. Yes, as of now I'm just showing. I will go for same. Now you can see the owner change is upendra. Suppose if I will show you here also. Now you can see as of now I'm going for my request AR. Okay. I will go for display. Now you can see into this particular request. Now the owner is change. Owner is this. I'll change also. Yes. Suppose I will put my name again. I'm just showing the demo. If someone ask your supervisor is saying okay just change the owner of this transport request. Okay. So you can go to browse. I'll just put my name again. Now I am the owner of this request. Again if I will refresh. Now you can see I am the owner again. Now we'll move on to next. So all these three operations covered. Now I'm coming on to next. This is widely used feature in project. Adding users to a transport request. see how a project works. Suppose you have a particular requirement in the project and suppose five people will work onto that particular requirement. So it is it it is not the case that all five will create individual requests. No, because it will create lots of confusion at the last because we need to release five transport request. So what is the best option? Maximum projects are following they will create one transport request and in that transport request there will be subtask for the five users. Yes. So all those five user the main request is one they will save their work in their respective subtask. So it will make their task easy. So this is the approach will which project always follow. Suppose as of now into this particular request this is main request and this is the sub request and this sub request is on my name only because as of now I am the only user into this particular request. So how we can add users to this particular request? You can simply right click onto mail request and you can see we are doing all these things using the transport organizer but the platform is Eclipse. So you can simply go to add user. You can see we have a option of change owner here also. If you want to go by this way I will go to add user. Suppose I'm adding another user. Suppose I'm adding coupon. I'll just browse. I'll check. It should not be the wrong name. Okay. I will go for sale. Now you can see into this main request. Now I have another task for this user also. Now this particular user will save the work into this particular subtask. Yes, I will save into this and at the last only one request will be released. Yes. So this is the way how we can add users to a transport request using SC09 and SC10. You all know very well is but now we are doing same to same thing using Eclipse. So we covered first four things creation done description done users done how to release a transport request that is covered previously also. Yes. How you can release? Yes, if you want to release, you can simply simply right click. You have a option of release here also. Yes. And you can see we have a option of release here also. It is totally your wish how you want to go. Suppose as of now I will just delete this particular task of another user because I just showed how to add. Yes. Do you want to delete? No, I don't know. I want to delete this. Okay, I want to delete the subtask of this. Sorry, I'll just go to main request again. I'll go to Okay, now you can see now we will release this transport request. So this is our request. You can release from here also or you can release from here also. Now the most important thing firstly we need to release the subtask. So I'll simply release the subtask. Okay. You can see request released successfully. Now we will release the main request. This is our main request. subtask is released. Now the main request is also released. Now the release process is going on. Yes, release has been done. Now you can see the status is released. If I will show you the program also. Now if I will show you revision history. Now you will be able to see one more request compare with revision history. Now you can see we have 907139. You can compare the versions if you want to. Anyways, we have not done any changes. You can compare also which is already explained. So these all five things done. Now I'm coming on to transport logs of a transport request. See this is important in what sense? Suppose I will go for simple understanding you why we release the transport request so that basis person can import this request to the quality system. Now if we want to check the request is imported to quality system or not we can simply simply check through transport log. Word itself is saying you are checking the logs of the transport request. In real projects many times we use this because we do not have rights to quality system. We do not have rights to production system many time. But if you want to check that your request imported to quality or not you can check through transport log. Suppose if I will show you this is the request which we released. I will go to transport organizer. Now we release this particular request 907139. Just double click here. Now you can see we have a option of transport log. Click here. Once you click on to transport log you will be able to see each and everything. In the development system we have this particular request. We have quality system. Yes, we have we release the request but it has not imported to quality system. If it is imported to quality system, we will get the description here. The request has been imported to quality system. This is the way how you can check the log in SC0910. You all know very well we have a transport log button here. You can see we have a transport log. But how you can check the transport log? Here you can simply simply check to this particular button and widely we are widely using in the projects. Now now we'll come on to last thing how to display a transport request. Now people will think yes every time you are going to this particular expand you are going to transport organizer. Suppose if we will go to transport organizer I'll just open again. Okay, we'll go to window show view other transport organizer. People are saying, people say every time you are going to modifyable, you are going to each and every request you are going to release and you are going for suppose if we have so many request and I want to check a particular request. Do I need to check by this way? See if you have a request number. How you can simply check? Suppose if we have 907139. So how you can do? Now it is released. So just right click on to released. You have a option open transport request. So you will simply write A4HK 907139. Now you can now you can see it will take me to that only. Yes, I'll just go to back button. You can see 907139. I'll just show again that it will make more sense. Suppose I'm opening transport organizer again. So how you can do? Suppose you want to check any modifiable request. Just right click on to modifyable open transport request. Just pass the number. Suppose I will go for this particular request because many times it is not the case that we'll go to each and every request and check. If you have a request number, you can simply search. You can see we directly navigated to this transport request. So what is the summary of this particular video? In this video, we covered the various operation on the transport request using transport organizer only but the platform is Eclipse. Now all these operations covered through SC09 and SA10 transaction code. Now we covered through Eclipse platform. So firstly we covered how to create a TR, how to change the description, how to change the owner, how to add the user, how to release, how to check the transport request, how to display a particular transport request. Now in the next video we'll cover further more operation. Suppose how to add objects to a transport request, how to delete objects from a transport request, how to delete a transport request. So we'll cover rest of the operations in the next video. So that's it in this video. Thank you.",

            "page_content": "Hello everyone, we will continue the topic about on HANA and currently we are covering various things using Eclipse and in the last video we started with transport organizer using Eclipse. So as a part of that what are the new learnings how you can open transport organizer through eclipse you can open by this particular button or you can simply go to window in the window yes suppose if you will go to window we have a option of suppose I'll click system is slow yes I'll go to window again we'll simply Go to show view. Whenever you will go to show view you will go for other and in the other you have a appab. In the abab you have transport organizer. So this is first learning how to open transport organizer through eclipse. Then after that yes how you can release a request through transport organizer of eclipse. That is a new learning. After that yes how you can check the version how you can check this particular program is into which particular transport request. So you can simply right click whenever you will right click you will get the option of compare with you can check the revision history. So as of now yes we have only one transport request for this particular program. So these are the main points which we covered in the last video. Now into this particular video we will go for version management using Eclipse in SAP GUI. You all know how you can check the various versions of a particular object. You can simply simply go to utilities. Whenever you will go to utilities you will go for versions. You can go for version management. You can check the various version. You can compare the various version. So you can do all these things by utilities version management. But how we can go for all these things in the Eclipse. This is our learning. This will be our learning into this video. Now suppose this program we saved into one transport request. But yes, we want to move this program to the quality. It means we need to release this transport request. Suppose we released this transport request and basis person moved that request to quality. Now in the quality system testing is going on. During testing the person is saying functional person is saying in the write statement along with the result I want a additional statement suppose if I'm running this particular program I'm doing function plus f8 suppose I'm giving suppose 20 10 suppose I'm going for execute now what functional is saying I want a statement here the result is then it should print 30. So it means we need to do the additional changes but yes we need to do the additional changes in development system we cannot do in the quality system. So whenever we will do the changes in the development system it means we need to save into transport request but we cannot use the previous transport request because it is already released. Suppose now we need to create the new transport request. Now it is totally your wish you want to create the new transport request through transport organizer or you can create from here also suppose I'm writing one statement suppose I'm writing the result is the result is suppose I have done this now whenever I will activate the program. Have you seen system is prompting for new transport request? Yes, you can create a transport request from here also or you can create a transport request using transport organizer. It is totally your wish. Suppose I'm creating from here. Suppose I will give the request description. Suppose I will write suppose operation on two numbers operation on two numbers. Suppose I will give the number as two. So we can predict very easy. Now you can go for okay. Now you will say I'm not able to see the transport request number. How I can check the transport request number that currently this program is into which particular transport request. So same thing right click you can simply go to compare with now go for revision history. Whenever you will go for revision history you will be able to see two versions. Now if I will go to revision history. Now you can see this is our first request. This is our second request now 07107. Yes. So currently our program is into this transport request. Just see that description description of two numbers. You can check from this transport organizer also. Go for windows or you can simply open from here also. Suppose if I will open from here you can go to workbench. Yes. A4 Q. Yes. Currently our request is modifiable. Have you seen this is the request 907106. This our program is into this request. If I will simply doubleclick you can see operation of two numbers. Yes, this is the description which we provided. So now if I will go to this particular request now this is particular program sorry this particular program. Now these changes needs to go to the quality system. It means we need to release this particular transport request. So how how we will release this transport request? So we simply simply go to transport organizer. Yes, this request is already opened. But do not forget to release the subtask. Firstly we need to release the subtask. This is our main request. Now suppose if I will close this so many things are open. I will close the other things so I will not confuse us. We simply open two things transport organizer and our program. Okay, this is our program. Now we'll simply open the transport organizer. This is our transport organizer. Now this is our main request. I will double click. You can see firstly release the sub request. There's our sub request. Yes, you can see from here itself this is sub request. We have a release. Done. Now we will release the main request. This is our main request. Sub request is released. Now we are releasing the main request. Now release has been started. So it will release the main request also. Now the main request is released. The status is released. Now go to your program. Now this program has two versions. Two versions. How you can check? Right click compare with. You can go for revision history. You can see you are able to see this. Now the thing how I can compare these two versions. Yes. What was in the first version and what was in the second version in SAP GUI? You have a button here. You can simply select the versions. You have a option here to compare. Now here how we will do the comparison. Just select these two versions. Right click. You can see compare with each other. Now it will show you. Have you seen we have done the changes into this particular line and it is completely highlighted one. So this is our first version. This is our second version. So this is the way how you can go for version management using the Eclipse platform. So what is the summary of this particular video? In this video we covered how you can go for version management using Eclipse in SAP GUI. You all know utilities version management. So to show the demo what I did I did some additional changes in the program. I saved into new transport request. I released the transport request and I showed you. Yes, whenever you want to see the see the various version just right click onto that particular program. Whenever you will right click go for compare with you can check the revision history. If you want to compare the versions select the various version you will you have a option compare you have option compare with each other simply compare the two versions. Now in the next video we will go for various operations on the transport request using transport organizer in Eclipse because in SAP GUI you all know but our target is to become friendly with Eclipse. So that's it in this video. Thank you.",

            "page_content": "Hello everyone, we will continue the topic back on HANA and currently we are becoming friendly with Eclipse. So as a part of that we covered how to create programs using Eclipse, how to create package transport request. Then we covered what are the various functionalities help available in source code editor of Eclipse. We covered function group, function module and in the last videos we covered how to create a BAB class using this Eclipse platform and yes I'm going for a perception that you already have the knowledge of this topic and you are learning all these things using Eclipse and I already covered it has major two significant benefit benefits suppose if your project is saying okay now do not make maximum use of SAP GUI make maximum use of Eclipse. So you cannot you will not stuck at that point of time because you because by learning all these you are becoming friendly creating all these things using Eclipse platform. Second, in the future whenever we'll cover a map on HANA objects like CDS views, AMDP, you cannot use SAP GUI to create all these things. We need to mandatory use the Eclipse platform. So it is benefited in both the ways. Now into this particular video, we'll start with transport organizer in Eclipse. We'll go for transport organizer using Eclipse. In SAP GUI, you all know we have a dedicated tool. We have a dedicated transaction code in SAP GUI. What is a transaction code? SC09 or SC10. That is a dedicated tool or transaction code for the task transport organizer. You are creating transport request. You are releasing transport request. You are doing various operations onto the transport request using this particular transaction code. Now we will learn same to same thing using Eclipse. Now because in the comment section when I say yes so many people ask yes. Now they want to learn transport organizer using Eclipse because their project is saying yes. Now use Eclipse for all these things also. So now we will start with transport organizer using Eclipse. Now if I will go for this transport organizer. You all know how to create a transport request using Eclipse which I covered. You can simply right click onto your project. Yes, whatever the project is there you can go to this menu. You can go to this others. Then at that time we created the transport request. If I will write you can see we created the transport request. But by going by this way we have a transport organizer. We have a dedicated transaction code. With the help of that transaction code we can do each and everything with the transport request. You can create release you can do various operations. Now we will go for same to same things using eclipse. Now so firstly how to open transport organizer. If you see we have a dedicated option here transport organizer. You can go by this way. If you do not want to go by this way. So what you can do? You can simply go to window. You can simply go to show view. You can go to other whenever you will go to other. Yes, if you see we have a option of a mapab here. You can go to aab and we have a option here for transport organizer or you can simply search here also. It will take you to transport organizer. You can go by this way. So it's totally your wish how you want to navigate to transport organizer through Eclipse. You can go by this particular button which is you can see it is in the form of truck symbol. Yes. Because that is a dedicated symbol to release the request also. Now you can simply go to window. In the window we have show view. We have other and whenever you will type it will take you to transport organizer. I will go for open. Now you can see transport organizer opened. Yes. And we are able to see transport request. As of now I'm working into this particular system. Yes. A4. You all know we have a ECC system also. But currently we are working in this S4X system. Yes, that is A4X system ID. But it is a SAP business suit for HANA. And you can see we are able to see three type of transport request. Yes, in SAP GUI we are able to see four type of transport request. If I will go here, if I will go for create, we have customizing, workbench, transport of copies and relocation. Here we have three things. So with the help of Eclipse platform you can create three type of transport request workbench request customizing request transport of copy. Anyways full information we have a dedicated playlist transport organizer but here our target is how we can do same to same thing using Eclipse platform rather than SAP GUI. Now what I will do? I'll firstly create a workbench request. You can create by this way also. But as of now our target is to become friendly with the transport organizer. So we'll create a transport request through transport organizer itself. So firstly suppose I will create a workbench request. Why I'm creating a workbench request? Because I will create a program. You all know program is a workbench object. So it will store into which particular type of request workbench request. So I'll right click here or you can expand here also. You will be able to see all the transport request you all can see. Yes. But we are creating a new transport request. So I will right click onto this workbench. New transport request. Now you can see same to same popup opened when we created the transport request from here. Yes, you can change the type from here also. You can see these three type of transport request. I will give the short description. suppose demo on okay suppose I will write development objects one why I'm giving one because I want to explain version management also so I will give the serial number so we can understand the version management very easily Now I will put the target system. I will go for A4Q. Now I will go for finish. You can see new transport request generated 907104. And this is the subtask. Just remember whenever you are creating a transport request through transport organizer in SAP GUI at that time also we have main request and sub request. If I will show you any of the request we have main request and sub request main request and sub request. This is just now I I'm able to see in SAP GUI also. You can see main request and sub request. Same thing is here. Now what I will do? I will create a program. I will save that program into this particular transport request. I'll just reconnect. Sometimes system is slow. Yes. Yes. reconnect. Now I will create a new program. Suppose I will right click onto programs. As of now you all know you have so many ways you can right click here. You can right click on package. You can write directly right click on programs. It's totally your wish. I will go for new appab program. Suppose I will give some name to the program. Suppose I will write Z P RG1. Suppose I will write sum of two numbers. Suppose I will write operation on two numbers so that it will make more sense and we can understand version management. I will give the description. demo. Okay. Operation on two numbers. We'll go for next. Now you can see this is the request. You can check here also. 907104. You can see 907104. Yes. Now I will simply go for finish. So my program saved into this transport request. You can check here also. Just go for your transport request. Now you can see this is main request. This is sub request. Now you can see my program saved into this particular transport request. Yes. Now I will go to the program. Suppose I will write some logic. I will write parameters P_input 1. Suppose type I will make a copy P_input 2. I will write the logic. Suppose LV_output is equal to P_input 1 + P input 2. I will declare I can go for inline declaration also if you know new syntaxes. LV_output type I. Now I will write this. I will activate this program. So now now this program is into transport request. I'll do shift + f1. You all know for pretty printer. Now we want to move this program to the quality system. Yes. Now this program is in transport request. You all know you if basis person will import it into this another system. We need to release that transport request. If I will go for our transport request. As of now this request is not released. You can see the status is modifiable. It is not released yet. So we need to release the transport request. You all know in SAP GUI through SC09 how you can release the transport request. We have a button here. We have a button release here. But how we can release the transport request here. Now we'll go for one mistake which many people do. Okay. What they will do? They will go to the request. This is our request. Now they have a release button here. They will go to release and they will get the error. Now they will say they are getting the error. See you are directly releasing the main request. Just remember in SAP GUI also whenever you are releasing a request you need to firstly release the subtask. Once you release the subtask after that only you can release the main request. I'll just log it. So firstly we need to release the subtask. Same thing is there. Suppose if I will go for display firstly I need to release the subtask then I can release the main request. So do not forget to release the main subtask. We will get the description here. Suppose if I will go for problems view, it will tell me you have not released the subtask. This is subtask 907105. So firstly release the subtask. Suppose I will close this. I'll just go for this particular request. This is subtask. You can see here now subtask is there. release the subtask first. Now subtask successfully released. Now go to main request. This is our main request. You can check here itself. Now in the main request, this is subtask 907105 and you can see what is the status it is released. Now we can release our main request. Now this is our main request. Now you can release. So this is the release button. Now you can understand how we can release a transport request using Eclipse using transport organizer of Eclipse. Now it is it is getting released. You can see we are getting description request for this start request release for this request has been started. Now this request is released. Now you can check the status 907104 it is released. Now you can go to your program. This is our program because many people will say yes how I can check this particular program is into which particular transport request in SAP GUI. You all know how you are checking the program. Suppose if I will go to SC38 transaction port and I want to check this particular program is into which transport request. Suppose I'm going for same to same program. If you want to check how you are checking, you all know very well you are going for utilities version management. Suppose I will simply simply go for utilities version version management. So you can see we are able to see this version. So our program is into this transport request 907104. But people will say how I can check in Eclipse because I'm not able to see any utilities version management here. So what you can do at that point of time just right click right click onto your program. Whenever you will right click you will find one option here comparison compare with sorry compare with. Whenever you will go for compare with go for revision history. Whenever you will go for revision history. Have you seen we are able to see this. So your program is currently into this particular transport request. We have your option here also. If you go here we have your option history here also. But I always rely on this particular option this comparison with. So with the help of this I'm checking. So what is the summary of this particular video? In this video we started transport organizer using Eclipse in SAP GUI. You all know SC09 and SC10 is the transaction code. You are doing creation of transport request operation on transport request. You are releasing the transport request. all these things through that particular transport organizer transaction port SC09 SC10 but now we need to learn each and everything using Eclipse platform. Yes. So how you can open transport organizer through Eclipse? You can open from here itself or you can simply go to window. Whenever you will go to window in the window we have a option sorry in the window we have a option of show view whenever you will go for other in the app you have a option of transport organizer now you will be able to see three things workbench transport of copy customizing I will not go not go into detail what is these types of request because you can refer to the playlist of transport organizer So we created a workbench request using transport organizer. We created a program and saved it to that. After that I showed you how you can release that transport request because if this program if we want this program to go to the quality system, we need to release the transport request first. But do not release the main request directly. Release the subtask. Then you can release the main request. Then how you can check your program is into which particular transport request. So you can simply right click. Whenever you will right click you will get compare with. You can check the revision history. Next video is extremely important because we will cover person management. See GL now customer is saying I want additional changes into this particular program but your transport request is released. It means we'll create a new transport request. We'll compare the transport request. We'll go for version management and other things into the next video. So that's it in this video. Thank you.",

            "page_content": "Hello everyone, we will continue the topic aab on HANA and in the previous video we started with how to create a ABAB class using the Eclipse. So as a part of that we simply created the ABAB class we provided two methods into the class we have written the logic for those two methods. Yes, in SAP GUI whenever you want to create a global class you are going to SC24 transaction code it's very easy there yes you can simply give the method name you are going for instance or static you are providing the parameters and you are writing the logic but here yes whenever you are creating through Eclipse yes we need to write the code by our own and this approach has two benefits S so many people are saying yes their projects are now saying yes go for Eclipse and make minimum use of SAP GUI so they are becoming friendly with the Eclipse platform second the most important thing is in the future whenever we'll go for CDS views AMDP AMDP is all about classes itself yes so at that time yes we cannot create all these things through SAP PGUI we need to mandatory use the Eclipse platform. Now into this particular video we will learn how to call these class methods inside a program. If you remember when we created the function module we called that function module inside a program. Same way now we will learn how to call class methods inside a program. So what I will do I will simply right click on to programs. You can right click on package. You can right click on project whatever the approach you want to choose. Suppose I will right click on to now programs. I will go to new back program. Suppose I will give the program name Z calling demo on calling of class methods. Suppose Z demo on call of class methods. I will give the short description demo on calling of class methods. I'll just change. I will simply go for next. Yes, [snorts] transport request done. Now into this particular program, I will take two parameters and two radio buttons for sum and subtract. Yes, whenever sum radio button is ticked, we will go for sum method. Whenever subtraction radio button is ticked, we'll go for subtraction method. So I will take firstly suppose parameter p_input 1 suppose type i. Now I will go for second parameter. Now I will take two radio buttons. So I will give go for parameters. Suppose name of the first radio button is P_R1. Suppose I'm saying type C radio button group. You all know how to create radio buttons. Now same way I will go for second radio button that is P_R2. We need to go for same radio button group. Yes, I will activate the program up to this level. You all know how to provide the selection text. You will right click. You will go for open others text elements. I will go for selection text. Suppose this is our first input. This is our second input. Now this is our sum. First radio button is for sum. Suppose second radio button is for subtract. Now I will simply activate. Now I will write the code. Now you all know whenever we will select a radio button the value of that radio button is capital X. So I will write if first radio button is equal to capital X. It means we need to call which method sum method. If second radio button is ticked we'll simply simply go for subtraction method. Now you all know whatever the methods we created into the class into this particular class Z class Eclipse both the method are instance method and whenever you want to call the instance method you can call through object. Yes object creation is compulsory. So what I will do? I'll simply go to program. Yes, program is already opened. Yes, this is the program. So I will declare one object first. Data hello object type ref. Yes. What is our class name? Z class_act. Now we will create the object also. You all know how to create the object. I will write create object. Hello object. If you want to use new syntaxes, you can use new. Yes, by that also you can create object. Now how to call method? You all know whenever you called the function module, you have written call function. Now here I will write call method. You need to write call method because here we do not have a pattern button. Yes. So I will simply write call method. Yes. What is the name of object? Because you will call the methods through object. Hello object. Now now just do one thing here. Yes. dot control + spacebar. You all know yes we covered. Yes, it is a code completion feature. Yes, in the future I will add two to three videos on code completion. It's a complete functionality itself. But as of now we covered chord completion. When we cover when we want to call the function module same thing is here whenever you want to call these class methods because see there's no pattern button. If you have a pattern button, it's very easy to call the function module global class methods. But it's not pattern icon is not there in case of this eclipse. So we need to use code completion functionality. So dot control + spacebar. Whenever we will do control + spacebar, we have the object I selected. And have you seen this arrow come? Whenever this arrow is there hyphen and greater than key it means it's a instance method. Whenever you have double whenever you have equal to and greater than key it means that's a static method. Currently we are going for instance method. Now I will do control + spacear again that is code completion. Have you seen two methods came automatically into this class. We have two methods sum and subtraction. I will go for sub. Have you seen everything came automatically? Import become export. Export become import. Now this is our first parameter. This is our second parameter. Now we'll simply unccomment importing. Now I will write lv output. I will declare lv output. Now same way we'll go for subtraction. We'll do the recap again so that it will become more understandable. I will write call method. Now you can simply give the name of the object. After giving the object name dot control + spacebar. Yes, you can call. Now after that you can again do control + spacebar. Now we will go for subtraction. Pers_input 1. Pers_input 2. Now here we will go for LV sorry we'll go for LV_out. Now we will declare SAP is very understandable in case of Eclipse. It is clearly showing LV_output is unknown. So we'll simply declare LV output tab. Now we will simply write the write statement. I'll write the same statement here also. Now you all know there is no pretty printer icon but we'll go for shortcut shift + f. Done. Now we will activate this particular program. Now we will test this particular program. So what I will do I will anyways debugging is a separate topic at that time I will explain each and everything in the debugging mode but as of now we'll check the output. So I'll simply go for F8. Suppose we are going for first input suppose 20. We'll go for second input 10. We'll go for sub. You can see result is 30. Now suppose we'll run the program again and we will go for subtraction. Now we will go for subtraction. 20 10 and we'll go for subtraction. Second radio button is capital X and you can see the result is 10. So what is the summary of this particular video? In this video we covered yes how to call the class methods inside the program. Yes inside the source code editor of Eclipse is best word we will say. So we declare two parameters, two radio buttons for two parameter for first input, second input, two radio buttons for sum and subtract. We declared the object. We created the object because our methods are instance method. So object declaration and creation is mandatory. Yes. So we created the object. Now to call the method, we have to return call method. After that you need to use the code completion feature because pattern button is not there. Go for control + space. It's extremely important feature and we'll go for separate videos on the same also. As of now you already know now the use. Yes, you used in the function module topic you used in the class method also. After that this import become export. export become import. We pass the input. We declare the output variable and we simply simply check the results. Now we have debugging in the future. Yes, because you all know debugging in SAP GUI but now we need to learn debugging in our Eclipse also. So in the future we will cover that debugging using this Eclipse. So that's it in this video. Thank you.",

            "page_content": "Hello everyone, we will continue the topic about on HANA and currently we are becoming friendly with the source code or editor of Eclipse. So as a part of that we covered how to create programs using Eclipse. Then we covered what are the various functionalities. What are the various help available in source code editor of Eclipse. We covered how to create package transport request using this Eclipse. Then we covered how to create function group function module. How to call function module in the source code editor of Eclipse. Now into this particular video we will learn how to create global classes using Eclipse. Now you all know in SAP GUI whenever you want to create global class you are going to SC24 transaction code but now we will learn how to create global class using this Eclipse. If you remembered when I covered the quick fix feature at that time I told you you already have one way how you can create a global class using the source code editor. You can simply simply pass the name of the class whatever the class you want to create go for control + one that is quick fix. That is one way to create the global class. But if you do not want to go by this way, I will simply explain from here itself because by this way we covered yes how to create a B programs. Then we covered yes how to create function group function module package transport request. Same way I will cover this how you can create classes global class by using this particular page. But ultimately it is totally your wish. If you want to create by the source code editor itself just pass the name of the class whatever you want to create go for this quick fix feature or if you want to go by this way it is totally your wish. So what we will do I will create global class. Now you can go by any of the way. Suppose you want to right click onto your project name then you can go for new. Yes, we have a option of a map class. Now the second way you can right click onto your package name. Suppose this our package name. Whenever I'll right click onto my package name I will go for new AB class. What is another way? If you already have classes available, if you already have a class into your package, right click onto your pack class and you can go for new about class. It is totally your wish how you want to create. Suppose I will create a class by right clicking on to package name. Now I will give some name to the class new ABAB class. Now you can see package name automatically appeared. Now I will give some name to the class. Suppose I will write Z class Eclipse. Now I will give that description. Suppose I will give class for operation on two numbers. If you want to provide some super class already existing class, you can pass. Yes, I will go for next. Now I will simply simply go for this transport request. Yes, we'll go for finish. Yes, now you can see this code appeared and if you remembered when we used the quick fix feature we got the same to same screen at that point of time also because ultimately it's same you are creating class through source code editor itself directly or you are creating by this way ultimately we are navigating to same to same thing Now it is very very easy to just understand this logic. You all know every class has a definition and every class has implementation. Now now if you still confused just see I will show you SC24 so you will get the clarity. Suppose whenever you are creating a class through SC24 transaction code you are giving some name to that class. Yes, we gave some name to that class. Suppose I will click on to create button. Now you will go for class. I will provide the description. Yes, I provided the description. Now you are going for this. Suppose we are going for public and by default final check box is tick. So whenever you will go for save yes your global class global usable appab class will create just see here same to same logic generate. We have the class name. Yes public this public is for this this this. Now final checkbox is ticked. Yes. Have you seen final is there? Now if you do not want this class to be final, you all know whenever your class is final, you cannot create subasses. So you can simply simply command this particular statement final. So whenever I will go for save our I'll go for save. So our global class is there. Same way we have this. Yes. So we have this class definition. We have this class implementation. Suppose into this particular class yes I will go for suppose two methods one for the sum of two numbers and one for the subtraction of two numbers. So what I will do suppose I will take these two methods as public method. You all know whenever you will go for public yes you need to go for public section. So what I will do I will just suppose create two methods and method will be instance method. Whenever you want to go for instance method methods is the keyword. Whenever you want to go for static method class methods is the keyword. Suppose I'm going for instance method. Suppose name of the method is sub. Suppose I will go for two importing and one exporting parameter. Suppose importing suppose first parameter is P input one. Suppose I will go for type I. Second parameter P input to type I. Now we will go for one exporting parameter. Suppose I will write exporting sorry P output type I in SC24 when you are creating global classes there's no need to write the logic in this way you will simply simply go here you will give method name you will choose instance or static you will go for public Yes, but here we need to write the code. Yes, now you will use the quick fix feature. You can see we have a method sum here. Now it is totally your wish. If you want to manually write the code, no problem. But SAP provided the quick fix feature. So it will save our time. It save our typing effort. So what I will do? Suppose if I will go here, it is clearly saying implementation missing for method sum. So if I will go for this way, I'll go for control + 1. You all know control + 1 is the shortcut for quick fix. It is clearly saying you want to add implementation for some method. Yes, we can add. Yes, it saves our efforts a lot. See, we are not creating global class using the quick fix feature. We are adding the method implementation using the quick fix feature because quick fix feature have save our typing efforts a lot. If you do not want to go by this way, it's totally your wish. You can manually write method sum and method. But I will use the quick fix feature. suppose control + 1 add implementation and have you seen it's automatically come now I will write the code P output is equal to P input 1 + P input 2. So our sum code is ready. Same way if I want to go for subtraction method suppose I will just copy the code and and now I will go for subtraction method. So I will go for sub su sub. Now you want to use quick fix feature because it saves our effort a lot. So I will go for control + 1. Yes. Add implementation for sub method. Yes. Now you can see this implementation added. Now we will go for subtraction logic. Suppose I will write P input one minus P input 2. Now I will simply check the syntax. It is syntactically correct. Now we will go for animation. So what is the summary of this particular video? In this video we started with creation of aab class or we can say global aab class and that is usual aab class. Yes, through Eclipse you all know whenever you want to create a global class using SAP GUI editor SAP GUI you are simply going to SC24 transaction code but here how you can create you can right click you will get a B class you will right click on your package then you will get a B class you can right click on your class you will get a map class so you can create a class Whenever you will create a class, you need to give class name. You can give the description. Yes, package transport request. Done. Now, whenever you will create, you will get these things class definition, class implementation. And I showed you whenever you are creating a class through SC4 also you are going for public from the drop-down public, private, protected, abstract. So, we are going for public. So public keyword is there. Final checkbox is there. That's why we have a final. If you do not want to go for subasses, take it as final. If you want subasses, then you can comment this particular thing. Now every class has two part class definition, class implementation. In SC2 it's easy. You can give method name, you can choose instance static, you can go for visibility. Yes, after that you can provide the parameters input and output parameter in case of global classes. But here using Eclipse we need to write the code. Yes. So I'm writing so I have written method sum method subtract. Yes. But you I use the quick fix feature to generate the method implementation logic because we covered quick fix help us. If we have method definition we can create method implementation but it is totally your wish. If you want to create this global class using the quick fix feature in the source code itself you can write this object type ref to class name. You can use quick fix feature you will get same to same screen. But if you want to go by this way, it is totally totally your wish. Now in the next video we will learn how to call these class methods inside a program because ultimately if we are creating a function module we need to call the function module inside a program. If we are going for class method, ultimately we need to call inside a program. So we will learn how to call these methods inside a program. So that's it in this video. Thank you.",

            "page_content": "Hello everyone, we will continue the topic a on HANA and in the last video we started with how you can create a function group and function module using Eclipse platform. Yes, using the source code editor of Eclipse. Now into this particular video we will learn how to call this function module inside the program because in SAP GUI also you did the same to same thing you are creating a function module but ultimately you need to use or you need to call into a program same thing we will see now how to call this function module inside a program. So I will create a program first. So I will right click onto my package or I can simply right click onto programs also and I can create a new program. It is totally your wish how you want to create. Suppose I'm right clicking onto the program. It will say me do you want to create new appab program? Yes. I will give some name to the program. Suppose I will write Z P RG tamo on call of a I'll just give that description. I'll just go for next. I will use same to transport request. Now you can see we have the new program. Previously we have four programs. Now we have fifth program. Now I will take two parameters in the program. Yes. Because we want to pass input. Yes. Because our function module is for make sum of two numbers. So I will take two input. You all know whenever you want to go for single input you are taking parameters. I will go for suppose first parameter name P_input 1 type I will go for second parameter tab P input to type I. So our two parameters are declared. I will activate the program up to this level. I will pass the selection text. You all know how to provide the selection text. You will right click onto source code editor. You will go for open others text elements. I will go for selection text. I will give first input and second input. Now I will write simply second input. I will activate. Now if I will go to program. Yes, our two input are ready. Now I will simply call this function bottle. Now the major thing will come. Yes, in SAP GUI it's very easy because you have a pattern button. Suppose if I will go to any of this particular program and I want to call suppose one function module inside this particular program. You all know you have a pattern button. You are simply going to pattern button and you are passing the name of the function model. You are going to pattern button. You are going for call function. You are passing the name of the function model. But we covered yes in Eclipse there is no icon for this pattern. There's no icon for the pattern. There's no particular icon available for the pattern. Then how how you will call this particular function module? Just write call function. Pass the name of the function module whichever you want to call. What is the name of our function module? Z fm_actives. This is the name of the function module. Now people will say what about parameters? Yes, we have two import. It should become export. Here we have one export. It should become import here. Then how how we will go for all these import and export parameter. Yes, here we will use code completion functionality. As of now I have not covered code completion functionality. I will also cover that and I will put that before this video. Yes. So that whenever people will come on to this video they will not struggle at all. But at this point of time I will just tell code completion. The shortcut is you can simply use control + spacebar. Just write control + spacebar. It will show you all the signature. So this is the way how you can call the function module because function modules has parameters. Yes, you can write call function name of the function module but you will not manually write those parameters. Yes. So how you can go for those parameter? Just write control + space. It is a shortcut for code completion. It will complete the code. Anyways, we'll go for detailed understanding of code completion. So as of now you know one important usage of code completion. Yes. To complete the signature of the function bottle, I will simply select after doing control plus space select. Have you seen import become export, export become import? We'll simply uncommit. In SAP GUI, yes, we will not think about this that because we have a pattern button there. In SAP GUI also we have code completion functionality. But yes, we can call through pattern button. So we will not face any difficulty there. But here we do not have this pattern button. Now I will unccomment. You all know what is the shortcut? Yes. Control + greater than. Now what is our first input? Pers_input 1 P_INPU 2. Now I will simply go for one variable here. lv output I will simply write you all know to print the output we need to go for write tab lv_out now I will declare this lv_output sorry system is slow lv_out output type I I'll check the syntax and I will activate now I will run yes now if I want to apply patty printer shift + f_sub_1 have you seen e1 converted to upper case yes because there's No icon for pretty printer. Now we will run. Yes. Using F8 key. F8 is the shortcut. Yes. Suppose I'm giving first input suppose 10. Second input 20. I will go to execute. So 30 is the result. So what is the summary of this particular video? In this video, we studied how to call function module inside the program. Yes, whenever you want to call function module inside the program, just write call function name of the function module. Yes, but how you will get those signature? Signature means importing exporting parameters of the function module. In SAP GUI, it's very easy. You are calling through pattern button. But here you need to use code completion functionality. The shortcut is control + spacebar. Anyways at this point of time this much knowledge is enough because we'll go for a separate videos on the code completion functionality. So in this last two videos we covered how you can go for function group function module through this Eclipse platform. how you can call function model inside a program. So that's it in this video.

            "page_content": "Hello everyone, we will continue the topic a on HANA and currently we are becoming friendly with Eclipse platform. We are creating various objects through Eclipse platform. So as a part of that firstly we covered how to create programs through Eclipse. Then we covered how to create package transport request through Eclipse. Then we are becoming friendly with the various functionalities of the source code editor of Eclipse. We covered what are the various help available in the source code editor of Eclipse. Now into this particular video we will cover how to create function group and function module through Eclipse. You all know how to create a function group and function module through SAP GUI. In SAP GUI, you are going to SC80 transaction code. You are creating function group. Then you are going to SC 37 transaction code. You are creating function module and saving that function module into the function group. But now we are doing everything through Eclipse and it is beneficial in both the ways. Many people are saying in their projects their supervising are forcing their supervisors are forcing us to use Eclipse. They are recommending us to use Eclipse. So they will get the full clarity how they can use Eclipse to create all these objects. And in the future whenever we will go for topics like CDS views, AMDP you cannot create all these things through SAP GUI you need to mandatory go for this Eclipse that's why we are putting so much stress so we will become friendly with this Eclipse platform. Now if you remember when I covered the quick fix functionality at that time I showed you also how you can create a function module through source mode editor itself at that time how you created the function module. In the source code editor you have written call function whatever the function module you want to create and you can simply go for control + one. You all know control + one is quick fix. That is one way to create the function model. But maximum people are saying okay suppose if they are not friendly with this particular approach they want to create in the same way they are creating the program. So into this particular video if you do not want to go by this approach no problem. You can simply create a function group from here. From here itself you can create a function module and you can simply call the function module into the program. So into these two to three videos what I will do I will firstly show you how to create a function group how to create a function module then how to call the function module inside the program because ultimately whenever we create a function module we always call inside the programs. So we'll go for all these three things but we will use the Eclipse platform. So firstly how you can create a function group. So it is totally your wish. You can right click on your project whatever the ABAB project is there you can go for new you can simply go for ABAB function. This is one way. Now suppose if you do not want to go by this way you already have a package you created the package. So ultimately we will go for that. I'll simply right click on the package. Now I will go for new other ABAB repository object. We use this to create this ABAB program. Now we will go for function group. So I will go for function group. I will give some name to the function group. You all know whenever we want to create a function module the first thing we need to create a function group because function group is a container for the function module. Suppose I'm giving ZFG apps. Suppose I will give some short description. Function group. I will simply go for next. I will go for next. I will go for finish. Now you can easily relate those who know SC80 transaction code using SAP GUI when they create the function group they will get these two kind of include top include and UXX include anyways it's I will not go into detail of this you can simply learn for this modalization technique playlist now our function group is there same thing I will say here do not forget to activate the function group. Now I'm going for application. Now you can see into your package if you will see we have now another icon for function group. If I will go for this package whatever the package is there. If you remember at the initial level we created the two program then one program for quick fix functionality. One program to show the demo on the icons. Yes. Then we created one include program. We created one class. Yes. If you remember when I showed you quick fix functionality. So have you seen everything is in our package itself. So in the package itself I can see each and everything whatever I created. Same thing in SAP GY you are doing. Yes. Now now we will create function bottle. Now it is totally your wish how you want to create a function bottle. You can right click onto your package. Suppose if you're right clicking on your package, you can go for new other aab repository object. You can go for function module. You can choose a function module and you can create. If you do not want to go by this way, right click on your project. You can go for new. We have a map function model. You can go by this way. Suppose if I will check here it do have a option in function group itself. If I'll right click on the function group new you can see we have a option of aab function model. I will go from here itself. So I'll simply go for aab function model. I will give some name to the function model. Okay I'll right click on function group name because if I'll right click on function group name function group name will also appear automatically. Suppose I will right click on function group name. I will go for new ab function port tool. Sorry I will go for new aab function model. Now you can see function group name automatically coming. Yes, it's totally your wish. You can pass manually also. Suppose I'm writing Z FM Eclipse. I will give the short description to make sum of two numbers. I will go for next. I will go for finish. Now you can see same thing appeared. If you remember when I showed you the demo of quick fix functionality in the previous video, I showed you how you can create a function module through quickfix. At that time you got save to same screen function and function and you got this command. You can use the template function module parameter to add the signature. Now we will simply simply use because ultimately it's same you are going by that way or you are going by this way. Ultimately you are creating function module now. Now now I will go for this template. I will go for function module parameter template. Now now I will go for two importing and one exporting. Suppose I will remove rest of the part. Suppose I'm going for first parameter P input one type suppose I suppose I will go for P input to type I. Now I will go for P output. type I please put dot at the last do not put in between otherwise you will get a error. Now I will write P output is equal to P input 1 + P input 2. I will check the syntax and now I will activate now P input. Okay, it is input. I'll just go for activation. Now you can see everything is activated. You can see from here also function group you have function module you have this function module. If you want to check in SAP GUI it's totally your wish. Suppose if I will go for SC37. Firstly I'll show you function group. Suppose from here itself I will navigate. We have function group ZFG Eclipse. Yes you can see we have function group function module is there. Now you will be able to see same code. We have written same code. If I will go for import, we have two import parameter. We have one export parameter. And this is the logic. Now people have two to three things which they asked previously also. If I want to make these parameters pass by value, if I want to make this parameter optional in SAP GUI, it's very easy. You can simply select the check boxes. But how we can do here? Suppose here if you want to make parameter pass by value. So just simply go for value word here. Just see here as of now they are reference. Just see here as of now they are reference parameter they are reference parameter now I'm making pass by value suppose I'm activating this now you will be able to see pass by value checkbox is tick it's activated now if I will show you the function module If I will display, if I will go for this, you can see pass by value stick and here also we have now value. Suppose I want to make these two parameter optional. So I'll simply simply use the keyword optional. Now I will use the keyword option. I will activate. It's activated. Now if I will show you this function module. If I'll go to back button. If I will display, you can see optional strict. We have the option. So what is the summary of this particular video? In this video we covered how you can create function group and function module through Eclipse. Now so as a part of that yes we created the function group first. You have so many ways you can right click on your package create the function group. You can create from here it is totally your wish. Then after that we created the function module. Again you have so many ways. You can right click on project. You can right click on package or you can right click on function group itself. Yes, but do not forget to activate the function group. Then we created the function module. And when you created the function module, you can realize it is showing you same to same editor. Yes, which you which we covered when we covered this quick fix functionality. At that time I showed you how you can create function module using the source code editor and using the quick fix functionality. But now we are covering how to create a function group and function module using here itself. Yes. Now in the next video the thing is we created the function module but now we need to call this in a program because ultimately we need to call this in SAP GUI. You all know you can call through pattern button but there's no pattern button here. Yes. So we'll learn how to create this or how to call this function module inside the program. But ultimately it is totally your wish how you want to create the function module. You want to use the source code editor. If you want to go by this way it is totally your wish. You can write call function name of the function module use quick fix create the function module or if you want to go by this way it is totally totally your wish. So that's it in this video. Thank you.",

            "page_content": "Hello everyone, we will continue the topic back on HANA and currently we are covering the various functionalities into the source code editor of Eclipse and in the last two videos we started with quick fix and in the last two videos we have seen that using quick fix we can do lots of things. It saves our typing efforts a lot because suppose if you have class definition you can simply generate the logic of class implementation. If you have method definition you can generate the logic of method implementation. If you have method implementation you can generate the logic of method definition. We can create the implementation for interface methods. Yes. If you have method call logic, you can simply generate the method definition logic. And in the last video, we have also seen we can create local classes, global classes through this quick fix feature itself. And the most most important thing is yes, I'm going for a perception. It is applicable to everyone that your foundation must be clear. You must have the knowledge of a programming. You must have the knowledge of abstracted programming. Suppose if you are directly learning quick fix and if you do not have knowledge of oops concept. So you will not be able to understand what definition is, what implementation is, what what method call is, how we are calling through object. So you must have the knowledge. Yes. Because what we are doing we are learning same to same thing now using eclipse editor. Previously we did everything through this GUI. Yes through this GUI editor. Now we are doing same to same thing through Eclipse editor. Now into this particular video we will go for last two things also. First one how to create a map includes. Yes, using this quick fix fix feature then we will simply see how we can create function modules through this quick fix feature. Yes, suppose if you do not have knowledge of include program if you do not have knowledge of function module. So it will not make any sense using this quick fix feature. So you must have the knowledge. Yes. So firstly we'll see how we can create a map includes includes means include program. Suppose if I will go for Eclipse source code editor of Eclipse. You all know include is a modulization technique and the most most important use of include program is for data declaration. We always put the global data declaration into include program. So what I will do? I will put this data declaration into include program. You can take any program whatever the program is available to you. You will you can simply simply create include program. Now we will see how to create include program using this quick fix feature. Suppose I'm writing a keyword include in SAP GUI editor also. Whenever you want to create a include program, you are writing keyword include. Yes. Suppose I'm giving some name to the include program. Suppose I'm writing Z include suppose underscore a bit. Suppose I will write data eclipse. I'm writing underscore suppose. Now you can see it is clearly saying yes include zinc include data eclipse note form. So we'll simply create this include program using quick fix feature. But what is a shortcut? control + 1. It is saying yes you want to create. Yes, I want to create. Now I will simply give the short description. Suppose I will write include program. In SEP GUI also you are doing same to same thing include name of the include program. Then you are doubleclicking and creating. Here we are using quick fix feature. Yes. Control + 1 I will go for next. I will choose the transport request which I already created. Now you can see we have the include program. Now I will simply simply cut this data declaration and now I will put into this include program. Now I will go for activation. I will activate this include program. I will activate our main program. This is our main program. Now you can see there's no error now. Now I'm activating this. So this is the way how you can create a include program using quick fix feature. So we have created include programs form source code. Yes, we have written the source code. We have written the source code. We have written the source code. Then we simply used the quick fix feature. Yes. Now many people will say here can I go for double click? Yes. Double click is not working. Yes. So you have to now next question is in everyone mind. Yes. Many people will think at this point of time. Suppose I'm passing a program which is already existing. Then what system will do in that case? Suppose now I'm creating a include program. Suppose I want to create a include program and that already exist. So what I will do? Suppose I will pass the name of the already existing include program. I'll just open this SAP GUI separately. So that it will be as it is. You can go to go through control + 6 also. That's not a concern. Suppose I Okay, this is the include program Z data dc order. Suppose I will pass this. Suppose I'm writing include I'm passing name of the include program and I'm putting dot. Have you seen there's no red mark here? There's no cross here because SAP understood yes it is already existing and it will not allow you to create. Suppose if I will go for control + 1 quick fix feature. So it is saying no suggestion available. So suppose now I will give unique name I will give underscore one. Now you can see it is in red red line is there. We have a cross symbol and it is saying it did not it it is does not exist. Now you can create. There's nothing for you to worry if you are passing an existing one. It will not allow you to do anything. There will be no suggestion. Whenever you are creating a include program using this source code and you are going for quick fix. Yes, it will clearly show you. Yes, you will get the red line here. You will get the red symbol here. So you will be able to understand. So we simply stud include program. Yes. Using with fix feature. Yes. Now we will move on to next. Our next is how we can create function modules using quick fix feature. Anyways in the future we have separate topic is how we can create function module function group through this Eclipse how we can create classes through Eclipse that's a separate video but as of now we are simply saying how we can use quick fix feature to create all these things suppose now I will go for function module using quick fix feature. So how you can create a function bottle? Suppose I'm writing call function. You all know whenever you want to call a function module, you are always always calling through call function. In SAP GUI suppose if I will go to SAP GUI. If I will show you any function module. Suppose if I will go for any program where we have the function module I'll just see you will always get a statement call function I'll just check if any function module is there system is slow yes meanwhile it is opening I will write into eclipse suppose I'm writing call function. I'm giving some name to the function module. From here itself I'm creating function module. Yes, I will use quick fix feature. Okay, it is taking time to open. I'll just write suppose I'm writing suppose I'm giving some name to the function module. Suppose I will write Z sum two numbers underscore eclipse. Now I will put dot. Now I will simply simply use the quick fix feature. So what I will do? I will put the cursor here. I will dot control + 1. Now it is saying create function module. It means this function module does not exist. Now people will say here when you created the include program and there that include program does not exist then SAP is giving the red mark here. Now why it is not giving in case of function module C we have put in single quotes. Whenever you will put in single quotes it will treat as a string. Yes. So here anyways there's nothing for you to worry just dot control + one. So if it already existing it will simply give you no suggestion available. But if you are going for control + 1 and that function module does not exist it will simply simply ask you to create. Suppose I'm going for control + one. It is saying do you want to create this function module? Yes, I want to create. Now important learning will be there. Suppose now I will give the description. Suppose function module for sum of two numbers. Now you all know whenever we want to go for function module we are always saving into function group. Function group is a container for the function module. That's why I'm saying you must have the knowledge of these topics. After that only all these things will make sense to you. Now here I will pass the name of any existing function group because in the future we will learn how to create function group function module through Eclipse. How we will create a map classes through this Eclipse platform. So we'll cover all these things. So anyways here I will just pass the existing function group. I'll check any existing function group. You can pass any existing function to and you will understand how powerful quick fix is. You just need to write the code. It will create everything. Suppose I will use this function. I will go for next. I will go for finish. function and function just relate those who have the knowledge of SAP GUI they know how function module is suppose if I will show you any function module I'll just go to SC37 suppose I'm opening this function module You will be able to see function and function statement. Yes, today's server is slow. Yes, you can see function and function. Same thing is here. Function and function. Function name of the function module. Function name of the function module. Yes. Now we will go for now importing exporting parameter. This is huge learning here. Yes, how we can go for importing and exporting parameters here. Anyways you can see SAP clearly given you can use the template function module parameter to add the signature. So people will think how to add the template. You will see a option here templates. SAP provided these templates. Now you can see we have function module parameter template. We'll simply use this and just see SAP provide each and everything. Just see here. I'll just make it here itself. Just wait. I'll just cut and paste here. Yes, I'll just generate again. I will just go for this templates function module template. Have you seen importing, exporting, changing tables, exception, everything? Everything coming automatically. Yes. Now I will simply write now the most most important thing here. Yes. Suppose now I will go for first parameter. Suppose my first input parameter name is P input one type. Suppose I'm going for I. Suppose I'm going for second parameter P input to type I. Now I will go for suppose one exporting there. I will not go for any exchanging tables. If you want you can take I will comment this or I will simply delete this. I'm going for one output parameter P output type I now I'm going for dot now I'm saying the most important point whenever people will use this they will raise that they are still getting the error it's not working for them and the most most common mistake mistake they are doing they'll put dot here have you seen whenever I will put dot here I'm getting a error here so they will say I'm continuously getting a error because you put the dot here dot must be at the last yes whenever your all parameters finished now I will write the code I will simply write P output is equal to P input put one plus P input 2. Now you can see function module ready. I'm simply activating this function module. Now I will simply simply show you this function module. If I will show you in SAP GUI everything is there. All logic is there. Now you can see we have the logic, we have the import parameter, we have the export parameter, everything but I created through clips. Yes. And I used quick fix feature. Suppose if I will go for this, I used quick fix feature. You have simply written call function name of the function module whatever you want to create and you can simply create into this particular way but yes we have separate suppose if I in the future I will show you how you can create function module function group a classes through Eclipse as of now I'm showing if you want to create all these things using quick fix feature itself so as of now I'm showing do quick fix feature and you can see how powerful quick fix is. You simply have to give call function name of the function model and you can do each and everything. And now I forgot to show you. Yes, suppose I'm calling this function module. If I'll show you any of the program in which we have the function module, I'll just check suppose I'll just go for any program where we have the function model. Suppose I'll go for this anyway standard function will also make sense. So you will be able to see every function module. Yes. Starts with call function. Whenever we are calling you can see call function. Yes. So same thing whenever you want to create a function module through the source code itself. So just give call function name of the function module use quick fix. Now now this function module is already existing. If I will do control + one again, now it is saying no suggestion available. There's nothing for you to worry. It will automatically tell you it is existing or it does not exist. So what is the summary of this particular video? In this video, we covered last two things for the quick fix feature. How you can create include programs through quickfix feature. how you can create function module through quick fix feature and yes you must have the knowledge then in that case only these things will make sense because what we are doing whatever we did through SAP GY now we are doing the same things through Eclipse. So how you can create include program? Include give the name of the include program. Yes. If it does not exist, yes, it will be in red color. You will get a red symbol. Create that. Yes. And you have can put the data declaration into that. Now next thing how you can create function module through this quick fix feature. So in your source code just write call function name of the function module whatever you want to create. Yes, it will ask you to create. Yes. Now after that it will clearly give you the documentation that which particular template you need to use. So you can simply go here you can use that template and you can go for importing exporting parameters. Yes. in in the future anyways as of now I'm showing you how you can use quick fix feature for all these things in the future I will show you yes how you can create function group function module a classes through Eclipse because in the previous videos I showed you how you can create a programs through Eclipse how you can create package transport request through Eclipse then in the future I will also show you how you can create function function group function module app classes using this Eclipse platform. So that's it in this video. Thank you.",

            "page_content": "Hello everyone, we will continue the topic about back on HANA and currently we are becoming friendly with the eclipse. So as a part of that we covered what eclipses, we covered ADT, we covered perspective, we covered a project after that we created the simple programs using Eclipse. We created the package. We created the transport request. We covered the various functionalities as a part of as this source code editor of Eclipse. We covered the help available in source code editor of Eclipse. And then we covered what are the various icons which are available in SAP GUI editor but they are not available in Eclipse editor. Now into this particular video we will go for locking mechanism. Locking mechanism in SAP GUI editor and Eclipse editor. We'll go for simple understanding first then I will come on to this because if I see the comment section today also so many people put this question yes they have not opened the program in the change mode but still they are getting the error of locking. So we will go for a detailed understanding of the same. Suppose firstly I will go to SAP GUI. So this is this is our SAP GUI SAP graphical user interface. Suppose I have this program. I'm going to change mode of the program. Suppose I'm going for some code changes into this particular program. Any other user cannot change this program at the same time because I'm changing this particular program at this point of time. So any other user cannot change the program at the same time. Even if I will go to SC38 transaction code. Suppose I'm going for another session and I'm going for same program and I'm going to change in another session. System will simply give me the error that you are already doing the editing for this particular program. Have you seen I'm getting the error. So this is your lock mechanism. Whenever you are editing, suppose I'm editing this particular program, any other user cannot change the same program at the same time. This is called as locking mechanism. Now along with SAP GUI editor, now we have have Eclipse also as a editor. Yes. Now, Eclipse also as a user interface. Same thing is here. If you already opened a program in SAP GUI in change mode, it means I cannot go for simultaneous changes from the Eclipse. Suppose one program is already opened in change mode in Eclipse then it means I cannot change the same program through SAP GUI because ultimately they both are user interfaces but our system is one. Yes, suppose if I will go to this particular Eclipse editor. Yes, we are working into this A4X system. If we are going for SAP GUI also. Yes. So I'm working into same to same SAP system we have two different user interfaces but system is ultimately same. Yes. So if you have a program already opened in change mode in SAP GUI then how you can change through Eclipse? If you already have a program opened in Eclipse in change mode then we cannot open through then we cannot go to change mode through SAP GUI. We'll just go for the we'll just go for the demo so that we can make sense. Suppose this program is already in change mode in SAP GUI editor. Suppose if I will go to now Eclipse editor. Suppose as of now you can see this program. Yes. Suppose I'm going for some changes using Eclipse editor. Now but it is already in change mode into this particular SAP GUI editor. Suppose I'm putting enter. Have you seen it is clearly giving me the error. object could not be logged because user AR hata is currently adding this particular program. This is what many people raised. They are saying they have not opened this program anywhere but they are not able to change the thing is you opened the program in SAP GUI that's why we are getting a error here. Suppose if I'm coming out suppose if I'm coming out here suppose now this program is in display mode in SAP GUI suppose if now I'm going for some changes now there's no lock nothing so I can go for the changes now this program is already in change mode in Eclipse now Eclipse now I cannot change through SAP GUI editor Suppose if I will go to SAP GUI editor and I'm going for change mode. Now it will give me the error. Sorry variant is stick. I'll go for source code. Now I will get the error. You can see user Rah Ma is currently editing. So this editing because it is opened in Eclipse it. That's why I'm getting this error. So this is a locking mechanism between this SAP GUI editor and Eclipse editor. So I'll just read the theory and important understanding from the interview perspective. Yes, the question is we can edit the same program in GY and in Eclipse simultaneously. True or false? Answer is false. False. We cannot edit the same program simultaneously. Yes, this is a locking mechanism. Both have same code repository. Your ABAB editor of SAP GUI and the editor of your Eclipse both have same code repository. So you cannot interfere when other is editing at the same time. So if you are editing in SAP GUI yes we cannot interfere through Eclipse. If you are doing the editing through Eclipse we cannot do the editing through SAP GY. So what is the summary of this particular video into this video we covered again one of the important aspect because yes it's the most common mistake. Suppose you are going to eclipse, you are going to ch you are going for some changes into that particular into a particular program but you are unable to do the changes but you are confused at that point of time that I have not opened this program into the change mode anywhere then why system is not allowing me the thing is you have opened the program in SAP GUI editor at the same time that's why you are getting this error. So both have both are user interfaces but we are working into same system. So as a part of that I showed you the demo. Yes. Suppose if you have a program opened in change mode in SAP GUI editor. Yes. If you go to the Eclipse editor you will get the error. You are getting a popup at that point of time. Yes. So just check at that point of time is your program already opening SAP GUI adder. Next thing whenever after that I'm simply going for changes through Eclipse. So if I'm going to SAP GUI and going for the changes system will not allow me. So this is your lock mechanism of this SAP GUI editor and Eclipse add iter and important question from the interview perspective. So that's it in this video. Thank you.",

            "page_content": "Hello everyone, we will continue the topic back on HANA and currently we are becoming friendly with the source code editor of Eclipse. So as a part of that we cover the various functionalities available in the source code editor of Eclipse. We cover the various help available in source code editor of Eclipse. Now into this particular video we will cover what are the various icons which are available in ABAB editor of SAP GUI but they are not available in Eclipse editor and it is extremely important from the interview perspective because any interviewer can easily predict that are you friendly with a bad editor? Are you friendly with Eclipse editor or not? So they will simply ask okay you work in SAP GUI editor you work in Eclipse editor. So just tell us what are the various icons which are available in ABAB editor but they are not available in Eclipse editor. So we'll go for the answer of the same. So firstly change/ display icon pattern icon pratty printer icon and if you remember when I covered the pratty printer functionality at that time I told you that in the future we have a separate video which will explain what are the various icons which are available in aab editor but not in a editor. So firstly I will come on to change/d display icon. Just see this is our SAP GUI ABAB editor. So have you seen we have a change/d display icon here. I can go to change mode of the program. I can go to display mode of the program. And have you seen in the all the videos when I created the program also there's no provision for display nothing whenever we are going for any program it is always always in the change mode I can write anything suppose for the better understanding suppose I'm creating a program suppose I'm going for package I'm creating a program other appab repository object. I'm going for a B program. Suppose I will choose this. I will give some name to the program. Suppose I will write Z demo on icons. Suppose I will give the short description. Suppose demo on icons. I will go to next. Yes, I will go for transport request. finish. Have you seen whenever this program opened it is always always in the change mode? Yes. Suppose if I will open this program at any point of time it is always always in the change mode. There's no provision of display mode. There's no icon of change/dis. There's no separate icon. We have this SAP GUI icon. We have activation icon, syntax check icon, we have all other icons but there's no icon for change/d display mode. If you tell this answer to interviewer can easily understand yes you have the knowledge of aab iter you have the knowledge of eclipse iter. So first thing change/dis icon is in aab GUI iterab of SAP GUI but it is not available in Eclipse editor. Now we will come on to next thing. What is next icon pattern icon. You all know one of the most important icon. If I will go for SAP GUI. This is our SAP GUI. We have this ABAB editor of SAP GUI. Have you seen we have a pattern icon here? Yes, we are calling the function modules through this pattern button. We are going for ABAB object patterns. We are simply calling the classes those methods. Yes. So this pattern button we are doing lots of things in SAP GUI ABAB editor. Yes. But if you go for this eclipse item into this eclipse, there's no separate icon of this pattern. Nothing. There's no icon available for this pattern. Yes. Now I will come on to third icon. What is third icon? Third icon is pratty printer icon and it is already covered when I covered this pratty printer functionality. If I will go for that particular slide also at that time I told you yes whenever we are going for printer there's no separate icon for the pretty printer we are going for shortcut shift + f1 yes shift + f1 is also in abab editor suppose if I will show you this abab editor editor of sapi so we have a icon here for pretty printer. But if you see there's no such icon available for pretty printer here. Yes. So what is the summary of this particular video? This video is extremely important from the interview perspective because any interviewer can easily predict that do you have exposure of eclipse editor or not. Have you seen or have you seen both the editor or not? So we are covering what are the various icons which are available in a editor of SAP GUI but they are not in Eclipse editor. So firstly we covered change/dis icon. Yes, we have a change/d display icon. Yes, but in case of Eclipse editor, there's no such icon available. Whenever you are going to any program, whenever you are creating any program, it is always always in the change mode by default. After that we covered yes pract icon. Yes, we have a pattern icon here. Yes, we are calling function module. We are calling classes. We are doing lots of things with the help of this pattern button. So in case of this eclipse iter there's no such icon for this. So there's no such icon for this pattern button. And lastly we covered yes printer. There's a pretty printer icon here. There's a pretty printer icon but is not available in Eclipse editor. Yes we have shortcut. Yes. Shift + F1. It is the shortcut in this aber also. If you see we have shift + f_sub_1. If I will go for this eclipse iterator. Yes, I can simply simply go for f1 here also. Yes. So that's it into this particular video. Thank you.",
